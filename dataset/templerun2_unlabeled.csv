"this is better than the first temple run in every way.
",3.0
"better graphics, more rewards with reasonable price tags (not the insane ""you must spend real money if you want this"" price tags of subway surfers), and an overall better upgrade path.

"unfortunately it does have a number of serious bugs:  1.
",3.0
"i paid 99 cents for some coins and the transaction went through, but i didn't receive my coins.
",3.0
"i don't care about the dollar, it was more a tip for making this cool game free than anything else,. however this bug did deter me from ever spending another dime on this game.
",3.0
"about 40 percent of the time, using a ""save me""
",3.0
"gem will crash the game.
",3.0
"you'll lose all the coins you accumulated during that run, plus the gem you used to crash the game.
",3.0
"dumping gems into a power-up is supposed to make it better i guess, but every time i'd exit the upgrade screen the meter showing how many gems i added reset.
",3.0
"so upgrading those is kind of pointless.
",3.0
"if you liked the first one, give this a shot, it's a ton of fun.
",3.0
"but if you can hold off a few weeks/months, until some of these bugs are squashed, you'll have a better experience.

"i like to play it! :)
",5.0
"fun game a bit lagged
",5.0
"really enjoy the game a lot of new features
",5.0
"graphics- the graphics are great compared to the original temple run and other games so i would give the graphics 5 out of 5.
",4.0
"new features- the new features are very cool but some of them have glitches.
",4.0
"for example, if you end a speed boost while on a zipline, when the zipline ends you will run at the same speed as a speed boost without the invincibility.
",4.0
"this also happens when you pick up a speed boost during one.
",4.0
"i would give the new features 4 out of 5, you shouldn't expect a new game to be perfect.
",4.0
"gameplay- the gameplay is similar to the original temple run but it runs faster and smoother.
",4.0
"there is a new coin system though, to fill up the power meter you need to collect 200 coins instead of the original 100.
",4.0
"also there more coins are on the playing field, shop items cost more, and there are less characters but hopefully a update will add more.
",4.0
"the menu can be a little confusing but shouldn't be to hard to get used to.
",4.0
"i give the gameplay 3 out of 5 because of its lack of new material in the shop and new coin system.
",4.0
"overall- overall this game is a great game for some quick fun.
",4.0
"i give this game a 4 out of 5, mainly for its great graphis and concept.
",4.0
"even on my note 2 the 1st temple run had its moments of choppyness.
",5.0
"whereas this version is fluid and effortlessly smooth.
",5.0
"responsiveness is also an improved joy on here.

"some fixes are expected: 1.
",4.0
"the sensors shall be more accurate.
",4.0
"there shall be more room on the broken bridge, as little bit of movement makes the runner to fall.

"i really enjoy playing this :d

"omg i play this all the time on my s3
",5.0
"there's several minor bugs i've noticed in the game.
",5.0
"first, when you use gems to increase the effectiveness of a power-up it shows that it costs only one gem, but it actually uses two.
",5.0
"second, the ""run 1,000,000 lifetime meters""
",5.0
"achievement is repeated.
",5.0
"out of the three challenges, it's listed twice, and running only contributes to one of them being filled up closer to completion.
",5.0
"picking up a power while the same one is in effect does not extend the duration in any way, though i don't know if that's intentional.
",5.0
"once it ended while i was on a rope: the invincibility ended but when i landed i was going the same speed and flew straight off the edge.
",5.0
"the second time i used the power-up boost during the ending of the invincibility frames.
",5.0
"not a bug, but i at one time had a problem with lag spikes.
",5.0
"to anyone on the s3 experiencing this, check that ""power saving""

"mode is turned off and it should work flawlessly.

",5.0
"only thing that might have improved it is by being able to see a complete list of objectives
",5.0
"excellent app, albeit completely addictive.
",5.0
"there is nothing negative i can say, except i would maybe prefer it if the characters had unique traits.

"it has literally never loaded on my phone an i have tried at least 60 times
",1.0
"if you have problems, click the menu button and then click settings, finally, put  quality on best.

",4.0
"great game altogether, but there is one glitch the developers should look into.
",3.0
"i have noticed several times that when i get a boost and then get one the ropes, sometimes there is some problems.
",3.0
"a) character slows down a lot on the rope section b) when you get off the ropes, the boost continues (what seems more rapid than normal), and the collision prevention is gone.
",3.0
"almost every time this happens, my game is over, because suddenly everything is boosted, but there is no protection.

",5.0
"it introduces a well done new coin/gem system, and they make their money without making non-payers too split on whether or not to buy a few.

"it's a great game.
",5.0
"generally it seems that the game improved a lot, the outlook is at least a whole new level, but the gameplay itself does not shine that much. - no sensitivity adjustment possible, step back from the first game - no magnet multiplier, so the store is really expensive + buying new characters now makes sense, not just waste of coins - annoying cave parts with the car (looks great and fun, but it's more like a pain for me)  - fixed objectives, no freedom in doing them as they come

"i give it four stars because, after only playing for three days, i am at a list of dredging objectives: 1,000,000 lifetime coins, 500,000 lifetime coins, and 1,000,000 lifetime meters.
",4.0
"at this point, there is no real point to keep running in this game.
",4.0

"why would i? and what would anyone do with 1,000,000 lifetime coins?

"there is more good to say about this game than what i've written here.
",4.0
"read other reviews and you can get a good feel for how well made this game is.
",4.0
"i give it four stars because, after only playing for a week, i am at a list of dredging objectives: 1,000,000 lifetime coins, 500,000 lifetime coins, and 10,000,000 lifetime meters.
",4.0
"at this point, there is no real point to keep running in this game.
",4.0
"and there are other insane objectives, such as 10,000,000 points in one run (you'll probably have to run over 30,000 meters in one run) and collecting 5 gems in one run (insane).
",4.0
"those were incredibly challenging, but that is why these challenges were worth attaining.
",4.0
"now, the only objectives i have left involve no skill, just running for weeks.
",4.0
"why would i? and what would anyone do with 1,000,000 lifetime coins?
",4.0
"all of the bonuses and power-ups in the game must cost no more than 600,000 coins combined.

",5.0
"this game is pretty fun.
",3.0
"it has plenty of unlocks and it improves upon the original game in many ways.

"temple run 2 is a bit 'busy' - more obstacles, objects and features than it's predecessor, but it doesn't compromise the playing experience.
",5.0
"the new format is more user-friendly and engaging, with the levelling option and ability to be resurrected per death.
