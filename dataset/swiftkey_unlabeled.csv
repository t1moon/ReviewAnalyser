"Stopped working again, unable to download language packs, despite already being downloaded.

"Chesty puller
",5
"Crashes chrome every 5 minutes.
",1
"Using an epic 4g touch with cm10.
",1
"I love it but I just wish it had a going down button but it's still the best keyboard I've ever had
",5
"This app is great works fast and accuracy is great worth buying.
",5
"Love this product.
",5
"Samsung's default keyboard was too slow to keep up with my fast/rapid typing!
",5
"This one keeps up with it and has better correction ability!
",5
"Love it since day 1
",5
"So when are we getting the new features like the ones for the Android key board?
",4
"Simple,  quick key response,  work great!
",5
"I really like this keyboard!
",4
"After coming from an iphone I was ready to send my S3 back.
",5
"The default keyboard is horrific.
",5
"This is absolutely amazing.
",5
"Similar to how the iphone works and I love it.
",5
".feature, recently announced but still hands down the best.
",5
"The fact that this is #1 in the play store should send a loud message to Google and device manufacturers that their keyboards are lacking.
",5
"No word prediction in various browsers.
",1
"Makes no sense.
",1
"No dedicated # row option either.
",1
"Company could care less about adding real functionality.
",1
"Feature requests for real functionality sit and collect dust while fluff skinning type ones get done.
",1
"Thank God I got it for a dime.
",1
"I'd like Japanese added.
",3
"I'd be happier with the purchase then.
",3
"Best keyboard on the market!
",5
"A MUST HAVE if you're upgrading from a phone w/ a slide out keyboard to a touch screen!
",5
"Trial version expired & I've had no word prediction - typing in every last letter, hyphen, quotation mark, you name it.
",5
"Will drive you crazy!
",5
"Just wait until the trial expires; you'll be upgrading.
",5
"Thanks for the trial & not making us decide based on reviews.
",5
"Don't get me wrong, this app is a lifesaver and I have recommended it to many friends.
",5
"I humbly propose some suggestions: 1.
",5
"For the semicolon (;) and colon.), it does not automatically delete the ""space"" prior like it does for the comma and period.
",5
"This is important, because if I want it to autocorrect the prior word, I need to press space to accept the suggestion, and the space also adds an actual space.  eg. shulf  -> shield    requires me to press space.
",5
"And when I do that, it fixes it and adds a space.
",5
"But if I want to type a colon or semicolon after it, I have to delete the space just added and then hold the appropriate key.
",5
"The quotation marks ("") point in a particular direction, meaning that they are the same both at the beginning or at the end of a quote.
",5
"There are two ways to fix this, as I see it: (1) have the keyboard automatically put in the forward facing quotes if they come before a word (""likethis) and backwards facing at the end of a word (likethis""), OR (2) use neutral quotes that just go straight up and down.
",5
"Thanks for a fantastic app, though.
",5
"I now have a pink keyboard!
",5
"So much easier than my old i phone keypad  and it is a pleasure to use on my Galaxy 2.
",5
"If only I could now find an app to change my black background on my emails!
",5
"First time I've ever purchased an app.
",5
"After the trial ran out I couldn't imagine going on without SwiftKey.
",5
"Thanks for a great keyboard!
",5
"94 percent amazing.
",5
"Never thought I would need a replacement keyboard app but when I got my Galaxy S III, the native keyboard was not working well for me.
",5
"This one just makes sense.
",5
"The best keybord. i have tryed out many others but no one is like this one!
",5
"I have emailed this company 3 times without a response!
",1
"Less responsive since last update and crashes phone often.
",3
"This is even after wiping my phone.
",3
"It can't spell or auto-correct correctly when writing in caps.
",3
"Still worth 3 stars because it's great in all other ways.
",3
"I was skeptical at first but this app is truly amazing.
",5
"I don't think I could ever go back to the stock Android keyboard.
",5
"Aber das ganze macht das Handy doch unn?tig lahm.
",4
"Super efficient and awesome :)
",5
"Nothing to add really, wish tablet version wasn't separate purchase.
",5
"By far the most useful and rewarding app I have installed to date.
",5
"At this point I'm essentially flinging my thumbs at my phone as fast as possible, and meaningful sentences come out.
",5
"The first few weeks were a bit tough while SwiftKey was still learning my style, but after that it's a breeze.
",5
"I am Vietnamese and I want to type my language.
",3
"Is it coming soon?
",3
"This app makes phone usage an amazing experience.
",5
"Works like a dream!
",5
"I used to use Swype thinking it was the fastest keyboard out there with some ok predictability.
",5
"I tried this app out and loved it.
",5
"I can't type on my phone without this great predictive keyboard.
",5
"I left my phone at home the other day and was using my friends android phone.
",5
"The stock Android keyboard is nothing compared to Swift Key.
",5
"Great prediction and all, but as the title says, keeps deleting words if I type too fast.
",1
"What's the point in creating a great keyboard if typing fast brings about bugs?
",1
"GIve option to disable swipe back to delete word at least.
",1
"The number keys should be able to be customized if you want them as a row on top.
",5
"On my way to 100000 keystrokes saved!
",5
"I have for the past year been using smart Keyboard Pro.
",5
"It has only been a half a day and SwiftKey by far surpasses my old keyboard and stock keyboard.
",5
"It blends well with Ice Cream Sandwich operating system.
",5
"Auto text including voice text is working nearly perfect.
",5
"Better if it can also learn from WhatsApp conversions
",5
"I love the auto correct.
",5
"I wish it would let me add custom words.
",5
"Seems like it won't stay the default keyboard on jellybean.
",3
"Asus Nexus
",5
"This app is fackin amazing I must admit I hardly av to type :p
",5
"If you text very often, you should have this application, you can write in a very short time
",5
"This keyboard has just the right amount of customization, I can change the height of the keyboard and the themes that come along with it look gorgeous on my super AmoLED screen.
",5
"Its predictions are always accurate for the most part.
",5
"And the new space feature is great!
",5
"Had the demo trial and it was decent this is even better.
",5
"Totally worth the $4.
",5
"Been using this a while and generally liked it.
",4
"Two-word prediction is a good update, but lately I've found if you mistype the first letter of a word, SwiftKey will never get it right, even for something obvious.
",4
"Seems to be since getting Jelly Bean.
",4
"Hoping the update will fix it.
",4
"I have had my bank account hacked into and i believe its from this app because it says when u install that it monitors your password etc.  Uninstalling!
",1
"Actually saves time and remembers your words, even slang you might use with your friends, and thinks ahead so u don't have to type full words!
",4
"Bit pricey though!
",4
"Would have preferred it to be slightly cheaper!
",4
"JB may be closing the gap, but this is hard to let go of.
",5
"This is the only reason I give 3 stars.
",3
"I prefer JB keyboard just because of the Swiftkey memory usage.
",3
"Potentially the best keyboard available.
",2
"However the thing keeps forgetting (or never axtually) saves custom words.
",2
"Surely aoat basic feature?
",2
"This app is gr8 i love how customisable it is and how easy it is to use but it keeps crashing my phone.
",3
"Its not like i dont have a lot of memory and such it is because the keyboard uses a fuk load of it plz fix this bug.
",3
"I just started using SwiftKey but has been great.
",4
"Ive always used go keyboard because of all the customization.
",4
"Different font, colors, background etc. Only thing thats a downfall of swiftkey.
",4
"Like 4 theme keyboards and you can't change anything else.
",4
"The stock Android keyboard gets better with every release, but the keyboard layout and excellent auto-correct on swiftkey 3 cannot be beat.
",5
"I have owned over 15 phones in the past 2 years, and by far the swift keyboard surpasses all of them.
",5
"I rarely make any mistakes and the more you use it the better it gets.
",5
"I have had this keyboard for a year and I really like it but it takes up to much space on my already limited internal memory.
",4
"The dot com button is annoying.
",4
"Best keyboard I have ever had I can't even find anything negative to say.
",5
"Won't install error 941
",1
"Autocorrect is frequently and obnoxiously wrong.
",3
"I can't find a disable option.
",3
"I LOVE everything about this keyboard.
",1
"Except the fact it drains my battery.
",1
"84% of battery is this app.
",1
"Best Android keyboard!
",5
"I like the app and the way it predicts words and gives the statistics.
",4
"However I would like to see more color selections!
",4
"Once you get used to this keyboard, you can never go back to the standard ones built into most phones.
",5
"Everything from the intelligent learning of your personal texting style to the sleek design and interface is polished and functions flawlessly.
",5
"Great App.
",5
"This is an excellent keyboard that I enjoy using for fast typing.
",5
"Glad it has Arabic support but it's missing Japanese as well.
",5
"When can we expect to see Japanese support?
",5
"Simply brilliant.
",5
"I love this keyboard so much but whenever I need to type in Japanese I have to switch to another keyboard.
",4
"Please help me by adding Japanese language support and then it will be truly perfect.
",4
"One complaint though, I'd really like to see a very plain and simple keyboard layout, plain dark colors no bringt blue or green contrast, and a similar in light colouring.
",4
"Very similar to the stock ics keyboard.
",4
"This is one of the most best keyboard for Android Phone.
",5
"It will be perfect if there is Chinese input.
",5
"It's a great keyboard! :-)  Would give 5 stars if a personal dictionary is added as well as the option to learn from whatsapp.
",4
"This is the first app that I have paid for ever.
",5
"Since the latest update it is not as predictive as it used to be so a little disappointed now.
",5
"If this keyboard didn't give spastic fits whenever I was trying to edit text or lag out doing whatever only God knows in a corner whenever I need to use it, then maybe this keyboard would outright be the best Android keyboard (Swype is a contender but it loves to spontaneously combust).
",3
"Otherwise, it has top notch word correction and extremely creepy and potentially embarrassing prediction.
",3
"One of the best apps I've ever downloaded!
",5
"I wasn't too impressed with the standard keyboard on the galaxy s3, but now.
",5
"Well worth the paid version.
",5
"I'm the kind of guy that has to stop walking to text (so not too hot at it).
",5
"I tried the trial and SwiftKey keyboard is a God send, hands down.
",5
"The only (albeit minor) complaint is that I am so used to spacing after a period and SwiftKey (being more efficient than I am) automatically creates the space.
",5
"Therefore, I sometimes write an unnecessary word.
",5
"You'll end up doing so anyway.
",5
"I never would have thought that I'd want a pay keyboard.
",5
"Then I tried SwiftKey and couldn't go back.
",5
"I have been trying just about every single keyboard there is out there on my galaxy s 3 and  just about every other word was misspelled or auto corrected wrong.
",5
"I've been using this app for a little bit and I can say it is by far the best you can get.
",5
"This keyboard's predictive ability is amazing.
",4
"It is really easy to use and the predictive text is much more accurate than the swype keyboard.
",5
"I even typed up an entire blog post on my phone.
",5
"All we need is Chinese input (strokes)
",4
"This is by far the best experience I have had typing.
",5
"Exellent app
",5
"this is a really great keyboard and I love it but the thing about it makes my phone lag.
",4
"I don't know why. only keyboard that does that.
",4
"I've tried a bunch of different keyboards and the only one that really works for me is SwiftKey.
",5
"The predictions are accurate and helpful.
",5
"Highly recommended.
",5
"This keyboard app is by far the best on the market that I have tried.
",5
"Fixes my spelling mistakes!
",5
"After using the stock keyboard and trying a few others I can say for English it makes typing on my phone much more bearable.
",4
"I don't like typing on touch devices, but sometimes I don't have a choice.
",4
"Now I'm just waiting for them to release Chinese and my Android keyboard needs will be fulfilled.
",4
"Ok, we need an update for this which until Jellybean came on the scene was faultless.
",1
"Now each and every time my phone is switched off and back on it defaults to the stock keyboard.
",1
"So I gotta go into setting and recheck SwiftKey as preferred keyboard.
",1
"This is by far the best keyboard app iv ever and will ever use in my life its a learning keyboard so I knows what your going to put next.
",5
"I wrote this mostly hitting the space bar.
",5
".feature, recently announced but still hands down the best.
",5
"Should be stock keyboard.
",5
"Tried the trial app 1st.
",4
"Great app.
",4
"Downloaded the full version.
",4
"Little disappointed.
",4
"I use the voice input quite often.
",4
"Doesn't work 90 percent of the time.
",4
"But overall good app.
",4
"But wish I could download more themes
",4
"Tried many keyboards, including Go keyboard and this one is the best by far.
",5
"This little app is a gem.
",5
"Don't even waste your time getting the free one.
",5
"Buy the whole thing you won't regret it.
",5
"This app has saved me so much time.
",5
"I can type fast without worrying what I am typing because it will auto correct and predict what I will say!
",5
"The only thing I'd like to see if the choice to add different themes for the keyboard other than that awesome app guys!
",5
"It's so good, hate using my phone keyboard, it's just not the same!
",5
"It's easier, better, and just faster.
",5
"I would have rated it 20/5 stars if we could just shortcut letters or words to other words.
",4
"For instance, if I were to type ""u"" it would automatically put ""you.""
",4
"And putting ""r"" would automatically put ""are.""
",4
"Amazing keyboard app.
",4
"Upgraded from trial.
",5
"Works WAY better than the stock keyboard on galaxy s3.
",5
"Also very setting rich-tons of customizing options.
",5
"No complaints on the !? slide  function.
",5
"I actually love that feature.
",5
"Well worth paying for IMO. :-) Most of the 'complaints' are actually fixable by adjusting the settings, jeeze.
",5
"Use it before you review it, duh!
",5
"Doesnt work with Emoji
",2
"Awesome app.
",5
"Been using it since I first downloaded it.
",5
"Haven't used the default keyboard on my phone at all.
",5
"After getting the GSIII I was a little bit unhappy with the stock Samsung keyboard and predictive text capabilities.
",5
"Without a doubt this new SwiftKey keyboard met and exceeded my requirements.
",5
"It has made me ""50%"" more efficient and saved me ""4000 keystrokes"" in less than two months.
",5
"I will highly recommend it to anyone with a new phone and I clumsy fingers.
",5
"Plus the endless personalization, themes, and colors put it over the top in my mind.
",5
"Extremely inaccurate when texting I hate this keyboard wish I could have refund.
",1
"Would have given this 5 starts if it worked well with king soft office.
",3
"Needs to switch back to abc after typing numbers and pressing space bar.
",4
"used to hate typing on my HTC one x but now it's a pleasure  :-) :-)
",5
"This the only app I've ever paid for.
",5
"Samsung Galaxy keyboard sucks.
",5
"Edit: Clearing the cache improves the performance somewhat.
",2
"But the stock keyboard is still faster.
",2
"However, now with Jellybean 4.1.2 when swift key is selected as default keyboard, it takes quite awhile for the keyboard to open up.
",2
"This delay is gone when I switch to stock keyboard.
",2
"Please check and fix this problem as I am used to swift key now.
",2
"Used to love this ,but recent update has punctuation and prediction bugs gallore.
",5
"By far the best keyboard available on the android market, tried it for thirty days and was immediately hooked.
",5
"Never thought I'd pay for an app, very glad I did.
",5
"Have been using SwiftKey for almost a year and it's hands down the best.
",4
"However, I can't believe there still isn't support for Chinese pin yin typing.
",4
"Like it most the time, but so SICK of it crashing when I copy/paste or even selecting text can cause it.
",3
"Also hate how hard it is to multiple space after punctuation, and other functions after punctuation as well.
",3
"Works great most of the time just wish keys were a little bigger and more themes
",4
"I am a recent switch from the iPhone and found the Droid keyboard to be horrible.
",5
"This app is a must have if you are an iPhone convert.
",5
"Don't wait a second to buy this one.
",5
"I can't even Download the lanuage packs.
",1
"If I find a solution I'll change my opinion.
",1
"This is the best app I have come across I love it never going back to regular keyboard again.
",5
"I love it but for some reason it's been waiting to have trouble with typing the right letters & symbols.
",4
"Also we need more themes!
",4
"After using swype I never thought a keyboard could be better. yet after using this after a few weeks I was sold.
",5
"I honestly do not know how I have been functioning before this app.
",5
"At first I downloaded the trial version to see what all the hype was about.
",5
"Unhelpful keyboard!
",5
"The layout of the smiley faces and the main punctuation keys just make so much more sense!
",5
"Had to cough up the 4 bucks for this one.
",5
"Excellent keyboard, my favorite since I had the original Evo.
",5
"Using it on my Samsung S3.
",5
"Needs better galaxy note 2 support.
",2
"As people have said, awesome predictive text,  but in addition to that, the interactions are smooth, the typing is much more responsive than stock AND it still uses the Jelly Bean native voice dictation and typo correction.
",5
"My favorite keyboard by far.
",5
"Please add more themes, such as an ability to choose the colors of the keys, letters, and background.
",5
"Also a bunch more customizable options.
",5
"I love being able to customize my phone.
",5
"Major issues with Chrome fields.
",1
"Jumps all over the place, erases characters.
",1
"Pretty much unusable.
",1
"I love this app, its just missing a few things.
",3
"Best purchase on Google play
",5
"When it works it's 5* but the constant error message 'Unable to load language packs' has annoyed me and made it unusable.
",1
"Deleting the folder in 'sdcard/Android/data' only works for about a day.
",1
"I used to have five star love SwiftKey, but now that I'm on ICS, I'm having lots of problems.
",2
"Two stars until they get their act together.
",2
"The best app I bought for my phone.
",5
"It makes typing on a small keyboard really convenient.
",5
"Since I have it I actually use my phone to write longer texts.
",5
"Auto correct and easy swipe delete make it worth the money
",4
"Been using it since basically day 1 of me on Android and couldn't even think of using another keyboard.
",5
"Text predictions randomly stop working.
",4
"This app was a revelation but seems to be worse now than when I first got it.
",3
"The big issue is that it regularly fails to predict very simple words when I omit the space or get just 1 or 2 letters wrong.
",3
"It's the fact that it's getting simple things so wrong that's the issue.
",3
"It also seems to have no understanding of concept, which wasn't so in the past.
",3
"The layout is still brilliant though and it's still a far better option than anything else but it's not as good as it was and improvements are needed.
",3
"But I don't understand why I need to pay again for a tablet version.
",3
"First purchase I recommend to all my friends switching to android.
",4
"Leaps and bounds ahead of stock keyboard on S3.
",4
"Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for that "".com"" button when you're typing in the address bar.
",4
"You'll understand when you're using the address bar to search.
",4
"Every unfocused attempt to click the space bar becomes "".com"".
",4
"Fix that and this app is the best in the play store.
",4
"Great app, helps a heeps load.
",4
"Add more themes, then I'll be satisfied.
",4
"Is that i can adjust the timing on the hold-key-to-get-symbol-feature.
",5
"I can insert numbers and symbols in 0.2 seconds!!
",5
"Once you'll try it, you will feel the urge to stop using the trial to have the complete version.
",5
"Whatever the problem was, it appears to have been fixed.
",5
"This keyboard rocks!
",5
"Love the keyboard but I frequently get ""cannot load language packs"" error.
",3
"Big pain in the rear.
",3
"There is a bug on function and shift buttons on physical keyboards with cm9 on this version.
",1
"Works fine with swiftkey x. I love it but it makes the physical keyboard nearly unuseable.
",1
"Once its fixed a solid 5 stars from me.
",1
"Typing this review using SwiftKey currently.
",5
"It's exponentially better than the standard keyboard on my sensation 4G and I like the customization.
",5
"One of the few apps I don't regret purchasing.
",5
"Great app!
",5
"I'd marry it if I had to marry a keyboard.
",5
"Love the app except for trying to enter form data and numerical predictions!
",5
"It locks on a combination and makes it nearly impossible to correct.
",5
"I have been waiting for Chinese input for more than a year.
",3
"Even swype has Chinese pinyin for quite a while.
",3
"SwiftKey need to cater for more market and introduce Chinese asap.
",3
"Why are smileys not long press on txt and chat apps?
",3
"I have even tried the Android 4.2 apk keyboard and this one is better.
",5
"I use this app more than any other app I have.
",5
"It's uncanny how intuitive this app is.
",5
"Definitely speeds up typing on these tiny key boards.
",5
"IT'S WORTH EVERY CENT AND THEN SOME!
",5
"The app works fine then all of a sudden nothing.
",1
"Again, reinstalled 4 times in the last 3 days.
",1
"Still waiting on Japanese support.
",3
"Every time the phone restarts I have to go and set the keyboard to swift key.
",1
"Terrific app,worth the 4 bucks!
",5
"5 stars, best app I ever purchased
",5
"Every time the phone restarts you have to manually change it back to SwiftKey, fix plox.
",1
"The default keyboard on the Samsung Galaxy S3 is terrible!
",5
"I almost returned the phone until I found this SwiftKey replacement for the keyboard.
",5
"I can type really fast with great accuracy now!
",5
"This app would be perfect if I could toggle none-to-all auto-correction features on/off.
",4
"For example, if I could turn off space after punctuation, or turn off the automatic removal of a space when typing a question mark, and so on.
",4
"This keyboard has great dictionary support but has way too many auto-correct features to be all-round useful.
",4
"It's sad that I have to disable the keyboard from time to time out of frustration.
",4
"Must have but it will be much better if there is an option not to learn from specific files.
",5
"I love this keyboard.
",5
"I just wish there were more themes to choose from.
",5
"The app is awesome when it's actually predicting and correcting your typing.  but it's quite often that the prediction tab across the top is inactive.
",1
"In these situations predictive text does not work.
",1
"And typing is tediously slow having to correct nearly every word!
",1
"Makes texting so so much easier.
",5
"Coming from an iPhone the messaging on my S3 was hard till I was told to download this app.
",5
"Fantastic and better then any other texting I've used.
",5
"Best keyboard I have used, muuuch better than the S3 standard.
",5
"Predictions are really useful (and accurate).
",5
"Still can't seem to do multitouch correctly.
",1
"They get detected as swipes and delete words and hide the keyboard randomly.
",1
"Add More themes!
",5
"It keeps getting better at predicting and correcting my messages/tweets/updates.
",5
"Seems somewhat laggy after jelly bean as well as not predicting as much.
",4
"I deleted because you can't take off Auto-Correct
",3
"I have the severist form of an autoimmune joint disease that makes it difficult to text.
",5
"Im young too, so it sucks.
",5
"This app adds to the quality of my life by recognizing my text style and remembering my words.
",5
"Fantastic word predictions.
",4
"Lost a star for the occasional stability issue.
",4
"This happens around once a month.
",4
"I have a galaxy s3 and hate the Samsung keyboard.
",5
"So I got this keyboard and I absolutely love it!
",5
"Wish there was more themes though.
",5
"This keyboard is amazing.
",5
"It's like Science Fiction good.
",5
"Near perfect accuracy for smart space, learns everything and predicts like it's reading my mind!
",5
"I can type whole emails without even having to spell out a single word.
",5
"I just tap the sentences out from the predictions.
",5
".but after last update it's total crap!
",2
"I'm using Croatian layout and we used to have Croatian letters underneath regular i.e. long press.
",2
"Now there are 5 croatian letters at most right making all keys unbelievably tiny!
",2
"And I don't want to type in landscape.
",2
"If you can't fix this (that ? is under c, ? is under z, etc) please refund me.
",2
"I'm sorry for one star, but this is completely your fault.
",2
"This is a very awesome keyboard with very accurate prediction, I love it very much.
",5
"But please add Chinese language support, really need it.
",5
"Fantastic keyboard app.
",5
"now constantly crashing on ICS
",2
"This app knows what i'm gonna type next just like a soulmate.
",5
"Bought it after using the demo for 2 weeks.
",5
"Great value and a real time saver.
",5
"Much better than stock ics its crazy yo
",5
"Best keyboard hands down!
",5
"Predictions are scary accurate and I just I just got a notification telling me that I've saved myself over 10,000 key strokes.
",5
"I finally have a keyboard that I like & love to use!
",5
"It does take a day to configure it the way you want it, but after that. awesome!
",5
"I never thought I'd be really ready to give up my physical keyboard from my smartphone.
",5

"My inbox is inundated with constant emails and texts which require an immediate response.
",5
"The Samsung keypad had it's advantages but I would still be keen to get things done faster which led me to download the trial version.

",5
"A few emails later and now I'm even writing a review which should speak for itself.
",5
"Really love the keyboard but new update changed layout for the worse for me.
",5
"No longer places apostrophes in I'm (it just types im or tries to correct to in).
",5
"No easy press for exclamation mark and question mark.

"The new swype beta offers as many as it can fit which is nice and that's why I used it, cause it had swype and accurate predictions(more than 3).

"After updating to Android 4.2, I had to download and install it again.

"I tried a lot of keyboards including swype, slide it &  touch, swiftkey is easily the best.

"This thing auto corrects like Jedi.
",5
"It's genuinely suppressing just how accurately its able to decipher my poorly executed key-mashing.
",5
"I've used many keyboards and this one is simply the best.
",5
"In fact, this is the first purchase I've made on Google Play.
",5
"The prediction is vastly better than anything I've used, and it only gets better.
",5
"Sometimes it predicts whole sentences one word at a time.
",5
"When the free trial expired I tried another keyboard (GO keyboard), and while it was decent, it couldn't compare with SwiftKey.
",5
"Great app!
",5
"But no Chinese input.
",5
"Would be really good if you guys could include that.
",5
"Terrible upgrade, the best thing about this app was the predictive text and now you just have punctuation options after each tines you press space.
",1
"Also tge new predictive guessing long words when you have only pressed 2 keys is ridiculous.
",1
"If I press 2 letters near T and O then press space I shouldn't get TIME. .
",1
"The keyboard works stunningly well with predictions and rapid typists like myself.
",4
"The only issues I've come across are text not displaying in the box when I type on occasion (which could be my launcher conflicting with my text messaging app) and the lack of visual customization.
",4
"Nice program :-)
",5
"Loved this app but I'm finding lots of errors when using it with my note 2.
",2
"i am looking forward that Swiftkey can develop the Simplified Cangjie Input Method quickly =] if it has Simplified Cangjie Input Method, i will give swiftkey 5 stars, make an all-out effort.

"Oh and plz add a hide keyboard button.

"Very quick and easy to controll.

"Plus like the look and feel.

"Just love this keyboard. its really awesome !!
",5
"Chinese simplified input please~~
",1
"Extremely accurate and customizable.
",5
"And when I say accurate I mean crazy accurate. the predictions are crazy good, especially after a while because it learns words that you commonly use.
",5
"I also love the shins and ability to fine tune haptic feedback. there isn't even a comparable keyboard out there.
",5
"Compared to swift key, go keyboard, stock keyboard, and all the other sit on the market is trash.
",5
"Worth paying for it.
",5
"Great app but it crashes often in chrome for me.
",3
"Usually on the Google homepage the keyboard freezes and stays on the screen.
",3
"The chrome issues are so frustrating because otherwise it's excellent.
",3
"Had trial Finally upgraded.
",1
"Keyboard lags, backspace only works till first letter of word then wont work, and swipe back causes errors.
",1
"SwiftKey keyboard is amazing!
",5
"I love it. :-) it is amazing the best application on the market can type a whole sentence with just one finger!
",5
"like my title says, this could really use the ability to learn from Google Voice, otherwise very good app!
",4
"Totally worth buying!
",5
"Awesome app, great improvement from the original SGS3 keyboard but I would love to have the swipe text and writing capability.
",4
"I love this app, this is better than original one for Samsung Galaxy S3.
",5
"I know SwiftKey wants to look hip and cool by adding a slide feature, but if I wanted sliding, I'd use SlideIT.
",2
"Increasing the spacebar real estate is completely useless.
",2
"I barely use the spacebar, because a space is automatically added when you insert a prediction.
",2
"Not everyone is using an S2 or new model phone, sliding is very unreliable on my older LG Optimus One P500.
",2
"I get a Question Mark half the time and my sliding left to delete works only 10% of the time.
",2
"Please allow us to customize the spacebar real estate.
",2
"Let us enable the question mark key.
",2
"I'd even recommend adding a Smiley Face key.
",2
"As I said, space bar is barely used in this app, don't give it any love.
",2
"Amazing :-D it makes it easy for me and makes my typing so much faster!
",5
"I totally recommend this app, it saves about me of time and it's predictions are most of the time accuracy
",5
"Amazing keyboard the predictions are amazing and corrects all my mistakes I just wish there were more themes or a way to customize it.
",4
"Works awesome better than the stock keyboard.
",5
"This app sucks.
",1
"Plain and simple.
",1
"Wish I could get my money back.
",1
"Great work, learns from all your mistakes and knows its grammar too.
",5
"The best,no s-pen detection?
",4
"Genius, much better keyboard all round!
",5
"I like it much better than some of the others I've tried, but it has some annoying, little problems.
",4
"Predictions are often great, but sometimes just stupid.
",4
"And certain things you type often, it won't learn, and constantly ""corrects"" you.
",4
"And while it will intelligently place a period or comma right behind the word you last selected, it won't do it for closing quotation marks, leaving a gap ""like this "" and you have to stop, & back up to fix it.
",4
"Nitpicky stuff, yes, but annoying.
",4
"My typing skills s___k. This app is truly a blessing.
",5
"I can send a message or email quickly and efficiently.
",5
"This app rocks!
",5
"It has the word I want to use before I do.
",5
"This is simply the best option available for a touch-keyboard on Android.
",5
"The predictions are smart and allow you to type quickly.
",5
"When I upgraded phones to a Galaxy S3, I briefly stuck with the default Swype-style keyboard just to see if I liked it, and I immediately missed so many of SwiftKey's features--not only the smart predictions, but the presence of symbols like ""/"" as alternatives to keys that become accessible by holding them down and dragging.
",5
"Design like this saves you from having to toggle through several other ""symbol"" sets of keyboards, and when trying to access commas or exclamation points, is indispensable.
",5
"If you miss using physical keyboards and are frustrated with touch keyboards, you need to try this one.
",5
"It cuts down on frustrations immeasurably.
",5
"Sadly got a VERY annoying new bug where I press the middle selection and sometimes it actually uses a totally different word!
",1
"Also it seems to have unlearnt all these years of learning.
",1
"Just typed this in portrait mode in under 7 seconds.
",5
"Absolutely brilliant!
",5
"I know you have your own reasoning but having a comma and period in the slider just increases mistakes.
",3
"I'm not going to use the slider for those 2 punctuations when they've already got their own keys.
",3
"Swipe right for question mark, swipe left for exclamation.
",3
"Make that change and it's 5 stars.
",3
"This has improved my typing so much.
",5
"Amazing stuff guys!
",5
"Love the keyboard.
",4
"The voice to text does not work most of the time though.
",5
"This apps helps you a lot when you are writing.
",5
"Since it learned your common phrases and words from the sms,  Facebook,  gmail.
",5
"Also you can customize the size of the keyboard layout when it's on portrait or landscape.
",5
"Highly recommend app!
",5
"The stock keyboard on my GSIII was driving me crazy.
",4
"SwiftKey has fixed almost all the issues I was having with typos.
",4
"Worth every penny
",5
"Prediction works very well,  the smart space is very interesting and useful.
",5
"The only thing I could think to suggest is custom colored keyboard themes.
",5
"This app needs Emoji.
",4
"I want to be able to talk to my friends who use it on there I phones.
",4
"I hated the Samsung keyboard.
",5
"You won't regret buying the full version.
",5
"Very cool, love it
",5
"I've tried all the other keyboards and this one is definitely worth it.
",5
"I never thought replacing my standard keyboard on the GS3 was necessary but I'm very glad I did.
",5
"This is much smoother and doesn't lock up and freeze.
",5
"Really does an incredible job, the predictions are really accurate, which is even freaky sometimes.
",5
"I am a lot faster than I was.
",5
"I wish there was a dictionary that I could edit to add or delete some words and more themes would be the best.
",5
"However, it's the best keyboard on the market, without a doubt.
",5
"Hi guys, I was wondering if you can add Whatsapp app to the personalisation of the keyboard.
",5
"Thanks for saving me 10,000 strokes, can use them elsewhere ;-) x
",5
"I love how the dictionary supports two languages at once
",5
"Faz o teclado do Iphone sentir vergonha de existir.

"I used to despise typing in portrait since this is my first full touch screen phone.
",5
"The stock keyboard was horrid but when I decided to switch over to SwiftKey.
",5
"Everything literally became easier and faster to text and/or type quick documents.
",5
"I wish it had Swype tho but either way, I'm still giving it a 5 star.
",5
"This keyboard is amazing and I love it a lot.
",5
"Uber-recommend.
",5
"Best keyboard ever, I highly recommend it
",5
"I had this keyboard for the past few months and I love it!
",5
"I heard that you guys are working on a swipe feature and ill be waiting for it!
",5
"Why doesn't it save swear words as primary words?
",4
"It doesn't even save the word ""gay"" as a primary word.
",4
"Which would mean this app is homophobic.
",4
"Saves time and corrects errors, quite good at predicting next words or phrases but if you make a serious typo or have fat fingers like me, you can rush off into a sentence and end up deleting / retyping loads of words.
",4
"Also can't find a way to remove such typos so it will predict incorrectly from time to time.
",4
"This keyboard let's me type as fast as I want and it corrects all my typos.
",5
"Cannot download the list of languages required to make this app work.
",4
"This bug was reported somewhere around the first of August and no solution has yet been reported by the developer.
",4
"A waste of money, imho.
",4
"EDIT: This is indeed fixed and therefor I change my rating.
",4
"Need more themes.
",1
"Saves a shed load of time with its predictions.
",5
"Very good app, worth the money.
",5
"So, I bought and paid for SwiftkeyX, and now you release a tablet version and I'm supposed to purchase the same app again?
",4
"After a number of frustrating months, they seem to have sorted the issues with SGS2.
",2
"It still has the odd hickup but generally works well.
",2
"For some reason the predictive text is not working at all. advise?
",1
"But now, every other time I go to use the keyboard, I'll type but nothing comes up
",3
"I don't think the price is out of line given how well this keyboard works.
",5
"The predictive text and corrections are nearly perfect.
",5
"I also appreciate that they give you a month to try out the full version rather than a dummied down version with tons of ads.
",5
"I won't be without this baby.
",5
"By far the best app I have installed.
",5
"It remembers stuff you say so well.
",3
"It remembers chains and predicts the next word.
",3
"There are a few bugs though and they're extremely annoying.
",3
"For example, the auto-correct and prediction will randomly stop working and I have to repeatedly exit and start again for it to work.
",3
"Sometimes the keyboard in general will stop working and it won't type.
",3
"I have to press random letters for about 5-10 seconds for it to work again.
",3
"Then when it finally does the first bug happens.
",3
"It's a great keyboard though.
",3
"If it swyped too, godlike.
",5
"This app is the best app I've ever tried.
",5
"It will transform your mobile experience.
",5
"The programming behind this must be stupendous.
",5
"The developers really go all the way into perfecting this jewel: the app learns about the way you type, the MISTAKES make, so it gets better the more you use it.
",5
"You can also customise keyboard size, and long-press time.
",5
"This single app makes android phones more worthwhile than an iPhone.
",5
"I would totally recommend this app its brilliant!
",5
"I would give this app 5 star if only it has simplified Chinese support
",3
"This is the best keyboard I've ever used.
",4
"Two issues I have are: No Chinese language support.
",4
"I'm a student in a Chinese speaking country and this would be very handy.
",4
"2, sometimes when I type very quickly, the word disappears.
",4
"Hope this can be addressed in future updates.
",4
"Apart from those, a very brilliant app.
",4
"After working superbly for months the app unexpectedly caused constant Force closes and lock ups on my Samsung galaxy s2 (freezing app with titanium backup solved the problem as I couldn't uninstall the app with all the FC's).
",1
"I Informed customer services via email and received no reply or confirmation.
",1
"Widely reported issues with the app not just isolated to the version on Amazon app store.

"Love I have a HTC One X I wish it had a vibrate option for every time you hit a key other then that great!
",5
"I would like it if it had an option where I could arrange some keys such as the number toggle to the other side and be able to choose our own type of layout, (HTC, stock android, touchwiz, etc.).
",4
"I'm sure this works as advertised, but I love Swype too much.
",3
"This app has made me laugh with surprise at the accuracy of its predictions.
",5
"I can sometimes complete full sentences just by tapping the words suggested.

"Useful extra features as well.

"Beautifully done  keyboard and so easy to use.

"This is probably the best touch board I have used.

"1-Would be great of the hight of the space bar can be adjusted to avoid hitting the lowest line letters.
",4
"2- add a feature to remove mis-spelled words 3- ability to utilize names in the address book to predict, or use the gmail address book for prediction-seems to be doing that but not very effective!

",5
"I'm wondering if an update killed the predictions, because they used to work.
",1
"Edit: It appears to be fixed.
",4
"I decided to buy full version but now I can't even complete the installation process.this is total trash and I am out of 4bucks!
",1
"Updated comment: New update has made it difficult to type a question mark at speed (surely one of the most common keys!
",4
"This is extremely frustrating.
",1
"I very much effort this application, but it has been rendered useless to me.
",1
"Please repair your product!
",1
"I'm using it under CyanogenMod 10 and it works like a charm!
",5
"I'm a big fan of this tool.
",5
"Awesome App.!
",4
"Gets  5 stars when, A Password Manager / Sync ability is added.
",4
"Or at least make it easier to switch between keyboards.
",4
"However, Im happy.
",4
"A lot easier to use than sywipe.
",4
"I love this keyboard and have been using it since I bought my Galaxy s2.
",5
"Seriously, and great app.
",5
"One of the best predictive text apps ever.
",5
"Wont get past setup screen
",1
"This app needs to stop adding spaces after punctuation.
",3
"If I add punctuation I hit space and now I get double spaces after commas etc! Needs an option to stop it at least!
",3
"amazing product, would be nice if it has swipe feature
",4
"Keeps freezing and writing nonsense on Google.
",4
"Plus really delayed writing.
",4
"I wish there was an option for IOS typing!
",4
"I  love this app, have been using it for 3 months now.
",5
"The predictions are amazing.
",5
"I think the app learns your writing patterns and tries to mimic them in the predictions.
",5
"This app makes typing so easy that I was almost paralyzed when I had to use a regular keyboard on my sister's phone yesterday.
",5
"I am not longer used to finishing my words.
",5
"Also, when I have had a problem, all that I have to do is go to their Facebook Page and they respond quickly!
",5
"This is truly the greatest thing I have ever seen.
",5
"It allows me to type on a touch screen without looking at it, that's how accurate itnis at predicting texts.
",5
"Best keyboard that u can find, thr personalization on it is just unpredictable!
",5
"It would be great if I can change the color of the words suggestions section in themes.
",4
"Overall, this is the best kb app I've found.
",4
"It claims to learn your typing style & I call bs on that.
",4
"Words I commonly use are constantly changed to completely different words & it can slow me down a lot.
",4
"I have the typing style set to precise & I'd hate to see how bad it would be in the predictive setting.
",4
"This review alone, I've had to fix quite a few of swiftkey's errors.
",4
"It's fixed none of mine.
",4
"I'd really like it if the precise setting actually meant it.
",4
"At first I wasn't quite sure the best way to use it, but after playing with it a bit, I found that even if you just utterly mash the keys and hash out words very quickly and sloppily, since it does such a great job at predicting your words it will still work very accurately.
",5
"Then if you have longer words in your sentence it's a lot quicker to hit one button to complete the last 6 letters of a word than to type it all out.
",5
"At first glance it seems like it's just another autocomplete, but it's so much more functional than that.
",5
"I couldn't type well until i downloaded the app.
",5
"Add emoji
",5
"Predict row gone after standby.
",2
"Backspace on auto correct doesn't undo correction.
",2
"Long press predict doesn't have similar words.
",2
"Reading the couple of reviews that wanted this program to understand text message shortcut language and then spell it out, I had to respond.
",5
"This is an awesome program.
",5
"It fixes my typos (which on a smartphone are often and many) almost always.
",5
"I would be a tenth as fast as what I am, without this program.
",5
"This is exactly what I've been looking for!
",5
"Love the keyboard but I frequently get ""cannot load language packs"" error.
",3
"Big pain in the rear.
",3
"Worth every penny, swapped my iphone 5 for a note 2 and was disappointed with the texting this app solves all the issues.
",5
"Best keyboard app on the market.
",3
"But the lack of customization is really this app back.
",3
"Everyone is obviously asking for it,  so let's make some progress please.
",3
"I love this keyboard but rhe original layout is tacky.
",5
"The pumpkin one looks amazing though.
",5
"If there was a green or red version of pumpkin i would be even happier.
",5
"Overall awesome though.
",5
"I would like to see a button to minimize the keyboard like the go keyboard.
",4
"Need update to get rid of bugs.
",3
"Bug1 - when swiping (ie to delete a word) , the last key touched is then entered.
",3
"Bug2 - auto-input of words seems a bit off.
",3
"Ie it is inputting words when I'm not requesting it.
",3
"Hard to explain the second?
",3
"Been SO sluggish lately.
",2
"I WANT NEW F****** DESIGNS.
",5
"So many options.it learns the way you type.looks great..what more could you ask for?
",5
"And the dedicated number pad is what every keyboard should have.
",5
". I sometimes have to wait up to a minute for the keyboard to appear.
",2
"Shouldn't have to restart my phone to be able to type an sms.
",2
"Also it seems to forget everything it's learnt on occasion.
",2
"Why did I pay for this when it seems to also be free and identical?
",2
"It's the best keyboard I have used by far, and I love the themes (but maybe a couple more?
",4
"Or a way to make our own?) but it has issues with certain words like page, which it often automatically capitalizes or it will change ""love"" to ""live""
",4
"It appears to be a minor glitch and not an actual function of the keyboard itself.
",4
"In lieu of these aforementioned issues being adjusted, I will gladly grant 5 stars.
",4
"^o^ Overall, an excellent job, you guys!
",4
"Can't download English US.
",4
"Forgets all my presets.
",4
"Still the best but has tapered back to the field a little.
",4
"Amazingly useful, had I known about this app earlier, would have switched from ios a long time ago.
",5
"Definitely helpful when I need to respond to something quickly.
",5
"It learns and may become smart enough to kill you.like in ""I, Robot"".
",5
"It makes it super easy to text in English then portugu闃?without having to switch to a completely different keyboard.
",5
"Found and reported a bug via email.
",1
"Developer won't respond unless I register for their forum.
",1
"This isn't customer service.
",1
"100% cannot live without you SwiftKey!
",5
"Hate hate hate the numeric keyboard.
",3
"With the new jelly bean update is there gonna be any support for emojis within this keyboard
",4
"I just wish they would come out with a lot more themes or give option to install custom made themes by other people
",4
"Isn't flawless, but it's assuredly the best on the market.
",4
"Much better than original Android keyboard!
",5
"Love the customisation options and themes!
",5
"Great but need an option for 4.0 and above to suppress language key in the status bar.
",3
"I deleted the stock keyboard because this is so good but I still get that because of voice typing.
",3
"Add that in and some more themes and it will be 5stars.
",3
"Have had the app for  > 6 months now, and as it continues to learn my usage, I'm getting down to typing as little as 25% of my final text.
",5
"Thanks guys, for writing this app !
",5
"What a great app so easy for for peeps with fat fingers.
",5
"I Only took me two hours to type this instead of the normal four!
",5
"Started using this the other day and I am amazed at how much better this keyboard is compared to the one that comes with the phone.
",5
"Much more accurate typing and the space bar is a lot bigger so I am not accidentally pressing unneeded buttons when I go to push the space.
",5
"This speeds up my typing so much, I just love it!
",5
"Bought it on S3 after using the trial for the full month, after which I had to upgrade which I obviously did.
",5
"The only downside to the trial is that I had to do 2 mins of settings upon installing the full version.
",5
"Runs smoothly and without any trouble!
",5
"Big improvement over standard Android keyboard.
",5
"But I do need to switch off some features that, for me, go too far.
",5
"Awesome at my sloppy big finger typing.
",5
"Fantastic, quite a mind reader!
",5
"With a recent update to Jellybean, SwiftKey no longer automatically uses predictions when texting.
",2
"I have to back out of every message and go back in before it will start fixing typos or using predictive text.
",2
"This is very frustrating and annoying.
",2
"Galaxy S3 with sprint.
",2
"Waste of money wot a rip off
",1
"I run my business from my phone.
",5
"I don't buy a lot of apps because I can usually find a free app that would do the job just fine.
",5
"I would buy this keyboard if it was 3 times the price it is absolutely awesome.
",5
"The way it anticipates what you want to type is almost scary.
",5
"Try for 2 weeks and see what you think.
",5
"I tried the free vs and was hooked!
",5
"Improved speed, freakishly accurate predictions, great layouts, attractive designs, makes typing on my phone more than just easy -I'm much more productive, too.
",5
"There is a horrible lag with jellybean, it shows up in Google now or right after a txt message is sent.
",2
"I saw this on an app review.
",5
"I downloaded the trial.
",5
"LOVED the trail so then I downloaded the FULL version.
",5
"Worth every cent. Wonderful tool to have.
",5
"I my typing accuracy is more better than before.
",5
"Some improvements should be made by increasing the amount of fonts etc and more personalising but apart from that this baby works like a charm and i wouldn't have it any other way!
",5
"I never thought I'd be paying for a keyboard.
",5
"But I bought after only a week of the 30 day trial.
",5
"Best setup and word suggestions.
",5
"This is great, absolutely love it and recommend it.
",5
"Very clever software that fixes most of my typos.
",5
"Just needs next/prev buttons on Web form filling like the Samsung keyboard has.
",5
"Way better than that default board with much more intelligent layouts.
",5
"?sign in the first page of num/symbol screen as well as the array of long press options.
",5
"Best keyboard app in the market!
",5
"I love this keyboard, I purchased I and it works perfectly in all save two situations:  use with google drive in typing long documents, it lags like crazy.
",3
"Use with google chrome it glitches out, becoming invisible and generally failing to operate.
",3
"freaks me out how it can predict my words kind of crazy but cool i hardly ever type the hole words any more just a few letters and it does the rest for me.
",5
"from a functionality standpoint it's great, but from a cosmetic standpoint it's lacking. need more themes.
",4
"I need the new update to swype in swift key!
",4
"This keyboard is perfect for me.
",5
"I wanted a bigger spacebar,  customizable layout and quick access to punctuation and emoticons.
",5
"The auto corrections are smart and configurable too.
",5
"I highly recommend this keyboard.
",5
"HTC Rezound.
",5
"Overall an interesting app.
",4
"Would give it five stars if some things would be attended to, like the ability to completely disable it on physical keboard, adding swype-like functionality or more complex control over automatic spacing or such removal of it in certain conditions.
",4
"Otherwise promising, bought to support.
",4
"Typing in 'Obama' will bring in highlighted suggested options 'is' which will also bring up the and then 'best' si it basically makes out ""Obama is the best""
",5
"Money well spent.
",5
"Have been struggling with the default keyboard on my new Galaxy 3.
",5
"Two weeks into the unhappy affair and I have finally got round to downloading SwiftKey.
",5
"I didn't realise how much missed you!
",5
"The best keyboard I've used.
",5
"Got this during a sale for 50% off and its the best value-for-money.
",5
"Its freakishly accurate in predicting my next words and symbols and numbers work like a charm.
",5
"I'd pay more for a beer so why not pay for a smart keyboard?
",4
"I I got the trial and less than a day later I bought it.
",4
"Brilliant for typing in different languages!
",4
"The ?character in Spanish isn't really needed these days though, hence my 4 star rating.
",4
"Wtf, it's draining my Batery, fix that please
",1
"Great app but they screwed croatian keyboard to the point of unusability
",3
"Awesome keyboard, end of story.
",5
"Swype works terrible on this phone, so this is a welcomed answer to the problem of typing.
",4
"The way it predicts my next word and corrects the current ones are just plain awesome.
",5
"I can just literally smash my finger around and SwiftKey will figure out what word I was trying to type!
",5
".but after last update it's total crap!
",2
"I'm using Croatian layout and we used to have Croatian letters underneath regular i.e. long press.
",2
"Now there are 5 croatian letters at most right making all keys unbelievably tiny!
",2
"And I don't want to type in landscape.
",2
"If you can't fix this (that ? is under c, ?is under z, etc) please refund me.
",2
"I'm sorry for one star, but this is completely your fault.
",2
"I tried this keyboard juat on a whim, i used to use the swipe input,but this way is a lot faster most of the time it knows what i am trying to say so it saves me from having to delete and try again,i would definitely reccomend this keyboard.
",5
"Wish I would have never updated.
",5
"Misses all kinds of letters now and not nearly as responsive as it was.
",5
"And hate that the question mark and period are the same key.
",5
"Until I had to reboot my phone.
",4
"Bought the tablet version then bought the phone version.
",5
"I am quite careless when I text sometimes I can write a whole word with only 1 or 2 letters right and it fixes it.
",5
"The prediction is ridiculously awesome and has a great memory on what you text often.
",5
"It also has cool colors you can choose from.
",5
"I've tried many keyboard but this one is the best of all.
",5
"Saved me hundreds of thousands of keystrokes.
",5
"Much better than stock Samsung, but like others are saying, a personal dictionary would be great and the word shortcuts.
",5
"It would also be great if you would release new features e.g. SwiftKey 'Flow' quicker.
",5
"Best keyboard out there, hands down.
",5
"Please add support for vlingo.
",5
"This keyboard is really great.
",5
"With it's adaptive speech, text predictions, voice input, etc., it truly is the best (and to think I used to use swype).
",5
"I have had 3 android phones and a tablet and I have this installed on all of them.
",5
"I even have it installed on friends' devices as well.
",5
"The only thing I can say that could certainly be better is possibly the auto correction and most definitely the grammar suggestions.
",5
"I like to be grammatically correct so it's an issue for me.
",5
"Every time my singular words get autocorrected to plural I wish I could get my money back.
",5
"This app is simply amazing!
",5
"A must have for every android user.
",5
"It even predicts when I'll call my mom!
",4
"It stores your strokes and you will have less chance to correct your spelling.
",5
"Android 4.2 keyboard is so nice looking,  please add a theme that look like that or add a theme with separate keys and no gradient shade on keys.
",5
"I do wish they would add different fonts.
",5
"This app is magnificent, it makes the default keyboard look like a piece of junk.
",5
"I hate this thing right noww i loved the old version.
",5
"This one doesn't put in the prediction if you press the spacebar and doesnt backspace the whole word if you just swipe it back and i dont like this layout change it back please!
",5
"I have used many a different keyboard in my life but this one is surely the best!
",5
"Give it a week to learn your writing style and it's predictions are perfect
",5
"How come it doesn't save the words that I have been entering for a lot times?
",4
"One thing I wish is that if we purchased this one, we get the tablet one free.
",4
"Other than that, I would never go back to a normal keyboard!
",4
"Great app.
",4
"Only complaint is lack of color options for the themes.
",4
"Otherwise amazing predictions and running smoothly.
",4
"I love the app, but I am still having the prompt come up asking me to select my default keyboard.
",5
"Every time I type it wants me to select default keyboard.
",5
"I'm mentioning it here because developer doesn't know either.
",5
"I have the Samsung galaxy.
",5
"I try to turn off my android keyboard but there is no option for it.
",5
"I know it's a android issue.
",5
"SwiftKey is easily the best keyboard out of the three that I've used (stock keyboard and swype being the others).
",5
"Not only is it more accurate with keystrokes and predictions,  but it also has a better layout and is more customizable.
",5
"I've been using it for about three months now and I'll never use anything else.
",5
"Well swift key is a great productive investment.
",5
"You will hardly type 30% of the text.
",5
"You haven't started using an S3 till you've used this app!
",5
"It makes typing a dream.
",5
"It reads my mind.
",5
"This app is the best thing on the market for sure!
",5
"It makes me want to type out whole paragraphs all the time.
",5
"I'm going to have to get the unlimited texting plan now or something.
",5
"Works great, looks great.
",5
"My only wish would be: that the typing field could be skinned to match the keyboard theme.
",5
"Long time user.
",4
"It's finally working on Chrome!
",4
"I don't understand why the predictions were so mediocre on my Rezound, but I'm thrilled with them on my Verizon Galaxy S3, usually.
",4
"Still wish for an option for the old small spacebar.
",4
"I don't like to inaccurately slide for punctuation.
",4
"Very nice app!
",2
"But why does nice app need more energy than the display. i had to deinstall it..
",2
"You cant beat thus keyboard.
",5
"Saves a lor of time.
",5
"I am new to android and this keyboard makes my 'Radpid' lifestyle so much easier.
",5
"Thank you SwiftKey!
",5
"I found one of the best apps for mobile.
",5
"Do you have similar program for desktop?
",5
"My typing speed increased like anything.
",5
"This is a good keyboard but has a tendency to lag when texting.
",2
"Sometimes I even have to restart my phone just to get it to work more smoothly.
",2
"It's annoying when it tries to guess the next word I want after commas and periods, but its Sooooooon much better than my standard keyboard system.
",5
"Pretty good,  comes up with some funny predictions though,  can be very annoying at times.
",2
"This app tight it just we just need more control over the keyboard more customizing
",4
"Needs Chinese language support
",4
"Absolutely handy..
",5
"Truly a superb app.
",5
"It must've saved me hours.
",5
"Really great vfm.
",5
"Good application for my Samsung Note 2.
",4
"Sometimes the auto correct feature doesn't appear and I have to exit the text message and re open it for it to appear.
",4
"I purchased the application but please address bug in next release.
",4
"Saves me so much trouble - often knows what I want to put even before I do! :p
",5
"I cannot judge anything.as I am not able to install the language files.when contacted support, reply is that they don't support custom roms.
",4
"please have an update which will support custom roms.or please alter the compatibility for app ,so that only people whose device will support the app will purchase .
",4
"Very much my keyboard of choice.
",5
"Takes twice as long to type a message due to all the errors I must manually correct.
",2
"On the other hand it is fun to just hit spacebar over and over to see what bizarre message it comes up with on its own.
",2
"This is a god send I have a small Android phone and fat fingers, this keyboard makes life so much easier for me :)
",5
"I've used most keyboards for android, I had the trial of this for a whole hour before I purchased the full version.
",5
"When transferring from the trial, it didn't keep my data.
",5
"I really enjoyed looking at my stats and my dictionary.
",5
"Maybe I did something wrong?
",5
"I hate the fact that you can't turn off predictions, and I also hate that you can't turn off the automatic space after punctuation.
",1
"Otherwise, this is a great keyboard.
",1
"I used to always use the Stock Android keyboard but have just found that the Jelly Bean one just isn't as good as this.
",5
"It's ability to correct what you type when you miss keys or mistype words is incredible.
",5
"My typing has become a lot quicker and I love the fact that there are so many options to customise this.
",5
"The prediction abilities are pretty amazing as well, it gives you a great insight into words that you use so often!
",5
"This is definitely the best 3rd party keyboard and in my opinion, the best keyboard to use on Android.
",5
"But pleeeeeease make more color skins available:-)
",5
"I came from the iPhone which made the Samsung keyboard the worst part of my day.
",5
"This app changed everything.
",5
"It's intuitive, corrects accurately 99% of the time and leaves every other keyboard in the dust.
",5
"Worth every penny.
",5
"Great keyboard.
",5
"I just love SwiftKey.
",5
"Ich liebe SwiftKey einfach.
",5
"For some reason when I paid for this app all the predictions went whack and it is much harder to write messages now not impressed.
",3
"Had this app for a while now,  all of a sudden unable to load language packs.
",1
"Saves me so much time when replying to emails and texts about my self defence classes.
",5
"Where I would have to repeat myself, or have to save a draft with all the info for a new student/client, I can now reply in seconds, but make the message/email more personal.
",5
"Trust me, it will save you so much time and effort that you will wonder how you managed without it!
",5
"First I was skeptical if it could be better than the normal Samsung keyboard.
",5
"And I must say its fenomenal much easier to write and so much for faster, love it.
",5
"It's magical how it detect what I intend to write, and also supports several languages at the same time.
",5
"Did extensive testing And Swift key was the cause of my widgets not refreshing.
",2
"Great app if it wasn't for that.
",2
"This keyboard needs to come into the 21st century.
",2
"It's missing swype and emojis.
",2
"I regret buying this app.
",2
"One of the only apps I've never had a problem with
",5
"The language pack finally downloaded so all is well for the moment.
",4
"The keyboard ant even keep with y fingers.
",2
"Works ok.  Don't like the look of it on ICS.
",5
"Plz make a nice ICS theme.
",5
"Every time I restart my Note 2 (AT&T Jellybean 4.1.1) it reverts back to Samsung keyboard.
",1
"I have to re select swift keys again to use it.
",1
"Please we need new and updated features in this our beloved keyboard app.
",5
"Likewise, a mini app version compatible with multi-windows feature in Samsung Galaxy note 1 and 2 is urgently needed.
",5
"I never comment on anything but had to about swift key.
",5
"This is by far the best app I have downloaded.
",5
"Need Support for Note 2
",5
"SwiftKey could be 5 stars but suggests Northumberland and Gloucestershire instead of words people use and wants to follow Julia with Roberts and Paul with McCartney so completely useless until that weirdness is sorted out.
",1
"My friend borrowed my phone to text our friend, and he said he could type faster on my phone than on his own iPhone, despite using Android for the first time.
",5
"Please work on Chinese input soon!
",5
"I hate switching to Google Pinyin.
",5
"This app is dam near perfect but i dont like that it doesn't have a swipe feature i dont like having to switch back and forth to use swipe which i use alot.
",4
"Awesome keyboard!

"I wonder if there working on a jellybean theme keyboard?
",4
"Plain and simple I would have gone back to my Iphone if it wasn't for this app.
",5
"Everything you do on your phone is surrounded by the keyboard and the stock keyboard was absolutely terrible.
",5
"Shame on Samsung.
",5
"But the keyboard should have swype.
",5
"I've tried a lot of keyboards for Android and this is the best out of all of them!

"For a fast typer I rely on the predictions and this is the best type of keyboard I need.

"Very good  Very fast best keyboard out there
",5
"JB 4.2 REMOVED BUT I NEED SWIFTKEY TO TYPE.

"I bought this app to support, I hope they add Turkish layout in future.
",4
"I'll raise it to 5 stars.

",3
"But I wonder; What's about speech input.
",5
"Couldn't SwiftKey come in after Google's speech recognition?
",5
"If Google is slightly wrong, SwiftKey would know better out of the context.

"Highly customizable, great auto-correct, fast (never misses a stroke).

"Does not work with Jelly Bean Update: 17/11/12 - problem resolved by update.

",5
"When I upgraded to android 4.2, I uninstalled Swype.
",5
"But the android keyboard even with gestures disappoints me compared to Swiftkey, which is better at prediction and as solid and reliable.
",5
"I cannot wait for Swiftkey flow!
",5
"More themes please, would be great a way to create customized themes
",5
"This keyboard is amazing cuts down typing time into fractions
",5
"Some minor issues, but by far the keyboard.
",4
"Pls update for note 2 one hand operation also putting numbers up top like default keyboard then this is the ultimate app
",3
"I used the trial and really liked it-would actually like to see more theme choices-how about black background with red or pink-red background with black or blue-even white?
",4
"My Typing App.
",5
"Every time I restart my device I need to make SwiftKey as a default!

"Have tried for days to download English language pack.

"Someone needs to add a forward delete button.
",1
"Talk to text,  wow,  never write a text message again,  neon keyboard looks great,  but it
",5
"Better than the vast majority of standard keyboards and probably the best keyboard in the market.
",4
"However, it would be better to have a larger, much larger, selection of themes!
",4
"Leggy Tosroe.
",4
"Awsome typing, even in spanish or english
",5
"Way better than the stock keyboard,  and I think it's the best on the market.
",5
"Please add more skins!
",5
"Like all the other buyers who bought this app said: I don't usually buy apps.
",5
"But when a friend of mine recommended it to me and I downloaded it, I have been amazed by it.
",5
"It is accurate beyond belief.
",5
"You would think that a keyboard app couldn't be THAT great, but that is where most people go wrong.
",5
"SwiftKey is not your ordinary app, it is of the next generation.
",5
"TLDR: get it, it'll be worth your time and money.
",5
"This is the best keyboard bin have ever used.
",5
"Definitely worth the price.
",5
"I install it but key taking me off the swift key goes back to regular keyboard what sup with that
",2
"Love that it's amazing at predictions.
",5
"Annoying and no better than normal keyboard.
",1
"Won't let you type in certain words easily and will often incorrectly guess and change words.
",1
"Even writing this it annoyed me a number of times.
",1
"Just plain awesome!  :)
",5
"Best typing app on the market.
",5
"Good predictions and very helpful when my fingers don't hit the right keys.
",4
"It's the only app I have ever paid for.
",5
"Saves so much time.
",5
"It's going to reduce the number of carpel tunnel cases in this world.
",5
"Best keyboard in the android market!
",4
"Predications are quite accurate.
",4
"Would be 5 stars if there is Chinese language input and one-operations keyboard.
",4
"A personal dictionary would be ideal too!
",4
"First I was disappointed by Google, because Chrome and Google Now were so laggy.
",3
"But then I found out that Swiftkey is the problem.
",3
"There is much less lag with the stock keyboard.
",3
"There is no Chinese language available until today?
",2
"Pls update soon!
",2
"***Pls don't buy if you want to type in Chinese.***  2.

"(both to work at the same time time)   3.
",2
"Can't scroll down when keying in pop up message, like filling up review now.
",2
"So I can't press ""ok"" and have to revert to HTC Sense keyboard.
",2
"Really great and helps improving the writing speed but there is one things I don't like.
",4
"If you try type for example 10 or 15 or something like that it always wants to correct it t the first number only.
",4
"Not that accurate if you enjoy tapping the buttons instead of gliding.
",2
"Keeps crashing when trying to tag posts on Tumblr app.
",3
"Emoji support would be awesome to.

"Works way better than my phones built in swype.

",5
"More themes please is all I ask!
",5
"Swipe functions broken
",1
"Du bliver positivt overrasket. jeg lover det. :-)
",5
"Keeps force closing before I even finish enabling.
",1
"Need you say more?
",5
"Okay fine.
",5
"It learns how you talk to better predict you and save you time.
",5
"The heat map is amusing also lol!
",5
"Auto correct is horribly inaccurate.
",1
"best keyboard out there with the some of the ugliest themes
",5
"The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous.
",1
"Allow the option to turn it off.
",1
"If you haven't tried A.I.type Keyboard, then you're seriously missing out.
",1
"I never really got into typing on smart phones before.
",5
"I use it for German and English and it's easy to switch language, I easily get all the ?, 眉's etc whilst keeping the prediction language I mainly need for that text.
",5
"I was actually looking for a keyboard that kept the extra line for the numbers.
",5
"But holding 'till you get the extra click works really well and the text prediction saves me so much more time.
",5
"I bought it after less than an hour!
",5
"Great job!
",5
"No no no! I was looking for an iPhone like keyboard but this does not cut it.
",1
"Sorry guys, it's slow and autocorrect is sub par.
",1
"Download the stock ICS keyboard and get the real android experience.
",1
"Love this keyboard!
",5
"This is a awesome app.
",5
"Way better than they stock keyboard.
",5
"Are there some hidden keys?
",5
"I only ask because somehow I manage to insert a fish when I press on a blank word prediction square above the predicted words.
",5
"Would give 5 stars if have more skin colors.
",4
"I was totally shocked by how much less typing I had to do.
",5
"It recognizes commonly typed sentences and allows you to choose the word.
",5
"This app is a keeper.
",5
"This is by far the best keyboard application on the android market!
",5
"Then a couple updates hit and screwed up the word prediction.
",2
"Has quite a few bugs with jelly bean like it always asking to select input method.
",2
"In all it got quite frustrating to use and personalization didn't seem to help a bit.
",2
"I had to uninstall and go back to the stock keyboard.
",2
"I absolutely fell in love with this keyboard after I tried out the demo version.
",5
"I vowed to buy it once I got my GS3 and have not looked back since.
",5
"I love it and would recommend it to anyone.
",5
"On gingerbread it was lighting fast.
",4
"On ICS its slow and gets caught a lot while typing.
",4
"Amazing will never use another app
",5
"The Samsung stock keyboard is appalling, this is not.
",5
"Quite simply put, if you try this app and get used to it you'll find it very difficult to go back.
",5
"I don't normally purchase apps, but for the sake of a pint, I made an exception for this.
",5
"Love this keyboard - coming from a phone with a hardware keyboard (Nokia N900), I was a bit nervous about moving to phones with soft-keyboards.
",5
"After downloading Swiftkey, I'm more than happy and love the learning type-ahead and it's ability to work out what I was trying to type when my big thumbs get in the way!
",5
"Great app.
",4
"The predictions work absolutely fine for other languages.
",4
"Will give 5 when swype is implemented.
",4
"I love this keyboard but u guys have to get better key sounds :( I don't like the one u have now!
",4
"I love this keyboard!
",5
"I actually can type without looking at the phone sometime. just Great!
",5
"It would be perfect if there was a backspace key!
",5
"Awesome once configured
",5
"Finally a use for Facebook and hundreds of SMS messages!
",5
"There had been highs and lows for this keyboard but it's the best and only one for me.
",4
"Better at learning words in my native language but would be better if it actually had my language.
",4
"Filipino/Tagalog pack and emoji plugin then 5*.
",4
"Would give 5stars if there's an option for Chinese language
",4
"Found out that this is overrated and auto correction can be a PIA.
",1
"Worse thing is that this keyboard drains your battery life.
",1
"I did some research on the Web and sure enough, other people are reporting the same issue with battery life.
",1
"Please fix battery drain problem.
",1
"I disabled Swift Key and my battery life has improved.
",1
"If you're thinking about getting this wait until the battery issue has been resolved.
",1
"If you could slide your finger to text then it would be amazing.
",3
"I'm using TouchPal!
",3
"Incredibly intelligent and fast keyboard software.
",5
"This keyboard makes it very easy to actually type things correctly on your phone instead of having the spelling and grammar of a second grader that is characteristic of many messages typed on cell phones.
",5
"Great keyboard,  not a fan of the smile face button though,  an option too remove that would be great
",5
"Sooooo slow.
",5
"I cannot fault this app.
",5
"No support at all.
",1
"no one to contact if u have problem.
",1
"whenever i wanna use the sign () it always write wrong and impossible to use.
",1
"many people try to contact and complain but nobody answer there !
",1
"i have tried to ask if possible to add ""numbers"" on top of the keyboard like on Samsung original keyboard and they sent me to write on their blog.
",1
"but no one answer, nobody care.
",1
"when they became good, they just ignore the customers at all.
",1
"i wish i wouldn't pay them !
",1
"p.s. it help to correct mistakes but in the stock keyboard i dont get any mistakes at all.
",1
"after a yer of disappointment and ignorant i am going back to the stock keyboard.
",1
"I didn't believe the hype but it makes typing so much better.
",5
"So much better than stock
",5
"Seriously, swear words are not allowed to be added to dictionary.
",1
"Otherwise good but don't upgrade to a tablet or they will make you pay again.
",1
"Going to go stock 4.2 keyboard.
",1
"Oh and the software hangs you wait and wait then it works.
",1
"It's a keyboard there is no reason why it should hang.
",1
"I shouldn't have to wait for my input device to load.
",1
"I type in spanish and english all the time.
",5
"With this keyboard I don't have to switch languages back and forth.ever!
",5
"Excellent keyboard app!
",5
"When my trial ended and went back to regular one, I immediately bought the full version.
",5
"This has been my very first paid app i've gotten.
",5
"Definitely worth the 4 bucks.
",5
"Horrible lag. <---- that message took 5 minutes to type.
",1
"Half of the time it's great, but also the other half of the time I feel like throwing my very expensive phone at a wall.
",3
"It seems as though it has become worse the longer I have been using it.
",3
"In fact I'm using SwiftKey to type this review.
",4
"I find the keyboard buttons more accommodating than on the default (JB 4.1.1) Hold-for-punctuation key is great.
",4
"Though the stock keyboard has this as well, I think SwiftKey did one better by distributing the special chars across more keys.
",4
"Prediction feature is snappy as it doesn't ask for permission to add to dictionary every time there's a new word.
",4
"My one complaint is that the accent char (usually with ""~"") is missing on UK keyboard as far as I can tell.
",4
"Its getting laggier very single update they released.
",3
"Usually takes a few seconds to keep up with my speed.
",3
"I have used many other keyboards and o have not been able to find one that comes close.
",5
"Make sure to take the long press time way down so you won't need to ever switch to the other screens!
",5
"I miss the classic Alphanumeric KBD on portrait mode.
",3
"Amazing and so clever!
",5
"Any other keyboard just doesn't cut it.
",5
"There is no better keyboard in terms of feel; how it feels to type with SwiftKey!
",5
"I would like to request two additions though: 1) to press anywhere in a word and be able to edit the whole word from that spot, not just the part of the word that's before it.
",5
"2) An option for the Galaxy Note/2 (and maybe other devices) with the ability to switch to a stylus friendly space where you can write out words like in the Samsung keyboard available for the Note 2!
",5
"I hated typing on my phone until I got this app.
",5
"Best keyboard, unbelievanly accurate prediction, and it now has Swype.
",5
"This is by far the best keyboard app for Android.
",5
"Well worth the investment.
",5
"Samsung Nexus.
",5
"Absolutely fantastic app.
",5
"Well worth the money.
",5
"My typing has improved massively in both accuracy and speed.
",5
"This keyboard is pretty good in general.
",2
"But it is lacking in languages it supports.
",2
"Realised it doesn't support Chinese after buying.
",2
"Please include Chinese for this.
",2
"i just got this yesterday, i had my doubts just like anyother key board and at first it was to me then i realized i wasnt even typing the whole word when i was texting lol and now i cant stop!
",5
"More themes plz update
",2
"Best typing system so much better than the standard Samsung one
",5
"Enabling SwiftKey makes my phone freeze frequently.
",1
"If you do not have this app and you text a lot then you are missing out hands down
",5
"Save me a lot of time when typing, excellent predictions, excellent performance using two languages at the same time.
",5
"In my case Spanish and English.
",5
"First app I bought, the developer deserves that buck.
",5
"Please add a casual black and blue theme (like the dark theme, but blue) and a black and red theme would be nice!
",5
"Great app I love it a lot.
",5
"This keyboard does a great job with its predictions.
",5
"I love when it knows the entire text I am trying to send! It is rather pricey, but definitely worth it!
",5
"Awesome, wish I could get more theams, but as close to perfect as you can get
",5
"Google's ICS keyboard isn't bad, but besides that I have never used another keyboard that even compares to this one.
",5
"I love the swipe to delete a word, and building sentences with the predictions and laughing.
",5
"Well worth the money I paid.
",5
"Update: lately when I open the keyboard sometimes the predictions don't show up until I close and reopen it.
",5
"Still love the keyboard on all my devices, but it's annoying.
",5
"Great keyboard but there is no way to enable handwriting recognition by either pressing a button or removing the S-Pen.
",3
"Also needs option for dedicated number row at the top like on the stock Note 2 keyboard.
",3
"Everything functions wonderfully but badly needs these features.
",3
"This keyboard is excellent and just keeps getting smarter!
",5
"The auto space after a full-stop is ridiculous.
",1
"Allow the option to turn it off.
",1
"If you haven't tried A.I.type Keyboard, then you're seriously missing out.
",1
"I hear of a swype-like feature . but is it on this version or a different app from SwiftKey altogether.
",4
"1.still no chinese language support 2.occasional hangs 3.frequently used punctuations a hit n miss affair with the sliding gesture. prefer a dedicated key.
",3
"4.currency sign is pounds simply because i prefer UK spellings? cant be changed.
",3
"Predictions for contracted I phrases sometimes work, sometimes don't. It's still worth 5 stars though, great keyboard.
",5
"I love this app!
",5
"love this app makes my phone stand out one thing I would love to see is a light shimmering affect that would work its way across the key board with different shimmer colors that said this iseasilythe best in the world maybe a few more colors for your key board.
",5
"Awesome for lazies like me
",5
"The keyboard focuses too much on correcting errors, and not enough on correctly detecting the correct keypress.
",3
"With SwiftKey, I have alot more typing errors (albeit corrected by SwiftKey) than with the Samsung keyboard.
",3
"I had a messaging phone cause i hate touch screen keyboards.
",5
"I downloaded this and now I use the screen only.
",5
"It make me type faster.
",3
"But the themes are lame.
",3
"Wish they would add some new schemes for the themes.
",3
"Gets boring very quickly.
",3
"Way better than GO KEYBOARD.
",5
"Uses a little less resources, also.
",5
"Customizations are perfect.
",5
"It really learns how you type & what you say.
",5
"Awesome keyboard and use it as my default keyboard on my S3.
",4
"But needs an option to increase the space bar key as i find it a little on the small side.
",4
"Can u make it so when u use the second tab to have the numbers across the top like normal.
",3
"The only thing I would change is to add an option for automatic updates for personalization.
",5
"Will not stay as my default keyboard.
",3
"I have used this app for a long time with no problems, but now, since the last couple of updates, it keeps going back to my phones original keyboard.
",3
"I dont kno what yall did but the spacing is messed up now and there is 3 blank squares so now every word I type im pressing the wrong letter than I expect to hit like all letters got shifted to the left.
",3
"Love the themes and features just fix whatever yall screwed up.
",3
"Would be nice to be able to adjust intensity as well as duration.
",4
"Great program to be able to type without major complications
",5
"I used free version I just fell in love.
",1
"Hated chatting bcoz cudnt type fast on touch keyboard.
",1
"Ppl say I'm changed.
",1
"In simple words SwiftKey really changed my life n saved a lot of my time.
",1
"But wen i purchased n removed old app my all saved stats gone.Wtever swift learnt from me is lost.
",1
"Dats baddd.
",1
"Plz do smting fr dis.
",1
"Did this happen to all who purchased da app.
",1
"Needs some heavy fixing with lag issues on SGS3, also force closes whe editing tags in Tumblr app posts
",3
"Recently came across your app and its amazing.
",5
"I did not believe how much of an effect would indeed having and now after only having used it for 24 hours I can honestly say that I'll be using it for the rest of my life.
",5
"When I initially got my GS3 it would simply not type what I WAS typing, it was insane.
",5
"Swiftkey is a god-send! Keep on fighting the fight!
",5
"This was the first keyboard I used on my phone when i got it, and it'll probably be the last one I use too.
",4
"Everything just works, customizable to cater to any performance needs as well as aestheticly.
",4
"I have one simple request I think would be an amazing addition to an already incredibly performing app.
",4
"Add a feature to slide the directional keys from the bottom so they don't get accidently hit whilst typing.
",4
"That is literally my only complaint lol.
",4
"Add for five stars!
",4
"Good for English and waste money for Cyrillics layout
",1
"Best prediction out there, but it mysteriously starts to lag (a bit) when there is a lot of text in the text field.
",4
"Especially strange because I'm using a one x+.
",4
"Awesome keyboard.
",5
"I've been using it through many of my Android devices but this time I bought it  .
",5
"They are also introducing a swype-style feature soon, which will make this the ultimate keyboard.
",5
"Make a deal with them and make this your S3 default keyboard.
",5
"Way faster than swype.
",5
"I used free version I just fell in love.
",5
"Hated chatting bcoz cudnt type fast on touch keyboard.

"Did this happen to all who purchased da app.
",5
"Would love it if auto correct could be turned off.
",5
"Wonderful, but no matter what height chosen, the landscape keyboard covers the whole display.
",1
"You just see the keyboard and nothing else.
",1
"What about being able to learn from whatsapp as I do most of the typing there (most of the people do).
",4
"It can predict my text very well!
",5
"Didn't regret paying for this app.
",5
"Buy it totally worth the money!
",5
"Could u set the numeric pad in the middle?
",5
"Great application.
",4
"It's predictions are amazingly accurate.
",5
"I never thought I'd prefer a touchscreen keyboard over a physical one, but this app has changed my perception of software keyboards and how they should work.
",5
"Its prediction engine is amazing, you can type very quickly and sloppily and the autocorrect will work well almost all the time.
",5
"If you allow it to, it can learn your writing style based on your sent emails, texts, Facebook and Twitter posts, which tunes the prediction engine to your unique style of writing.
",5
"Highly recommended!
",5
"Not sure why but I'm experiencing lag on swiftx 3 lately :( getting quite annoying,  I'd hit a key dead on and get no response
",3
"Great app.
",4
"Seems to be ""forgetting"" my words.
",5
"And I just had it learn them too -_- anyone else?
",5
"Space after comma or period is hit and miss. Please make it easier to delete words that were saved on accident.
",5
"So confusing to delete words.
",5
"Some are so easy, others don't even give the option.
",5
"Why does it capitalize words like Page?
",5
"Title says it all, it works great on Android 2.2 but will only work sporadically on Android 4.1.
",1
"The predictive text is the problem.
",1
"Unfortunately I have to stop using this until it is fixed.
",1
"I'm trying to keep this because I really liked it at first but this lag of type 10 words and it's still typing one letter at a time on the first word back  is frustrating.
",3
"Only thing it's missing is more themes; can't wait for Flow.
",5
"With Swype continuing to get worse I thought I'd give this one a bash.
",5
"So glad that I did as it's amazing.
",5
"Much quicker than Swype because I don't need to correct things as much.
",5
"I often type constantly switching languages.
",5
"This is able to correct and predict even when if I were to mix them in one sentence!
",5
"Great job.
",5
"I purchased a new Samsung GS2 to replace an older phone.
",5
"I was loving everything about my new phone until I began sending texts and realized that the stock keyboard was totally worthless.
",5
"I seriously considered returning the phone, since sending text messages had become such a chore.
",5
"I had previously owned an HTC phone and it had the types of features that Swift Key has.
",5
"Once I installed Swift Key, I loved my new phone again.
",5
"Swift Key totally rocks, I have showed it to a number of friends and they have all been amazed by it.
",5
"I previously had an HTC phone and loved the keyboard on it.
",5
"While I love my new Samsung, I hated the keyboard it came with.
",5
"This comes pretty close to the HTC keyboard, and the corrections and predictions are even more accurate.
",5
"Get the trial first to make sure you like it, but I love it.
",5
"This app didn't work on my old SE X10i and now I've upgraded to a galaxy nexus it still doesn't. Really?
",1
"This is the best Android replacement?
",1
"It's dire on my Samsung galaxy nexus if I press the space bar I get an I inserted?
",1
"The predictive words thing does not work on my stock browser????
",1
"Was loving this, but since the OS Update on my Samsung Galaxy s2, I've had a lot more auto-correct mistakes.
",4
"Writing an extended post on fb, I then somehow lost it.
",4
"I was amazed how swift key actually remembered the whole paragraph without having to type every word again.
",4
"Overall it doesn't always pick the words you want but it's close enough.
",4
"Absolutely amazing!
",5
"Highly recommended.
",5
"Worth purchasing
",5
"Genuinely a fantastic keyboard.
",4
"Thoroughly recommend this.
",4
"Grab over the sale.
",4
"Pretty disappointed due to no android emoji.
",4
"Can't you make to option to themes?
",4
"Just like auto mode n' manual?
",4
"I mean in auto mode on system time ( or custom time setting or light sensor)  change between 2  themes that user selected.
",4
"Manual mode having all the time users selection.
",4
"Just because I always use dark theme.
",4
"But it not best option in sunlight.
",4
"Coming from the stock experience it takes a day or so to adjust.
",5
"This app would be perfect if Chinese is included.
",4
"This app allows you to look good with touch type.
",5
"I had a iphone and this is a really challenger to that sms system, only downside is that you can't add words to dictionary
",5
"Love this & the tablet version!
",5
"Easy to use & very intuitive.
",5
"Samsung Galaxg S3 I tried the trial and then uninstalled it.
",5
"That only lasted a few days - I got out the credit card and made the purchase (for half price, too).
",5
"I really, really wanted to find a free keyboard, but nothing events and came close.
",5
"This thing is really smart, and I spend more time on the predicted list than I do punching letters.
",5
"Makes texting and composing emails super fast.
",5
"Good work on predictions but the keys should work more efficiently.
",3
"in the tablet version :(
",3
"I'm writing so fast and smooth right now.
",5
"Great keyboard!
",5
"You only need to make it more customizable.
",5
"Best keyboard I've ever used

"Yo vengo de la aplicaci贸n swipe, pero este me gusto mucho m谩s ya que la predicci贸n de palabra es sumamente incre铆ble, yo uso mi tel茅fono horizontalmente a la hora de escribir ya que me encuentro bien inc贸modo escribir de la otra manera.

"En tan s贸lo unos minutos me he acostumbrado a este teclado lo cual marca la diferencia con el swipe el cual me tom贸 varios d铆as en aprenderlo, pero la gran diferencia entre las dos aplicaciones es la manera de como reconoce y elige la palabra correcta.

"Worth every penny because of the amount of time it saves you.
",5
"This is a solid keyboard app.
",4
"A must have for any touch smartphone not just android phones.

"Loses a star because a) should be the default keyboard for Android phones really and b) no swype feature yet.

"But all in all love it and took advantage of the $1.99 thanksgiving sale price.
",4
"This keyboard is the answer to my prayers I'm so in love with it but my only complaint is the themes they look like an old lady made them yes the neon is the best but it's kinda hard on the eyes.
",5
"I got my Galaxy S3 recently and was worried about not having a physical keyboard, but with this app, my typing speed and accuracy are almost same as having a physical keyboard!

"One thing I miss from a previous version is the ability to customize the amount of keyboard that needs to be swiped before the previous word gets deleted.
",4
"There are many times where what I've typed gets deleted because my fingers move fast enough to where the two touches are registered as a swipe.

"Better if Chinese input is supported.

"Fantastic keyboard.

"Really is worth the cost.

"The installation is stuck at trying to download the language packs.

",1

"When this gets implemented, I'd be more then happy to give 5 stars.
",3
"This keyboard is good and thnx for making it.
",4
"The one I didn't like is the vibration when typing.
",4
"I dont make anymore mistakes!

"Just needs more themes!

"Chinese language?
",4
"If not, add a key that allows changing of keyboard.
",4
"It's a big hassle to change keyboard and key my Chinese character.
",4
"But the other keyboards allow swift change to SwiftKey.
",4
"This is a decent keyboard app.
",3
"The predicted words database can be pretty impressive at times.
",3
"I would absolutely love it if you guys could make an update that would allow the user to be able to type in a SWYPE style format instead of having to punch letter after letter.
",3
"This would seriously speed up typing.
",3
"If you could provide this update, I will be more than happy to reevaluate my rating.
",3
"This is the best, most accurate, keyboard I have used on Android!
",5
"The best and most used app on my Galaxy S3.
",5
"Very smart predictive text that quickly learns how you talk.
",5
"Definitely recommend trying the 1 month trial, you won't be able to go back to the stock keyboard after the trial.
",5
"Bought this for my s3 and it's brilliant, using it for my nexus7 now, thought I'd try the tab version after seeing they had a sale on, just missed it:-(  now thinking about it, for 3 quid, you should be getting both.

"Won't be paying full rate for the tab version.

",2
"Best keyboard app in the market.
",5
"The best keyboard but a little glitch when texts come in the keyboard messes up really bad and freezes.
",3
"It needs a button to lower the keyboard instead of having a back space everytime.
",3
"The keyboard crashes my phone!
",3
"This keyboard is really good with the exception of not being able to disable the pop-up on key press.
",4
"Only other thing I would like to see is the ability to colorize the keyboards myself.

"Smart space works really well and the auto correct works really well.

"So much better than the built in ICS keyboard.
",5
"I wish Google would buy this company.
",5
"You really dont know what you are missing if you dont try it.
",5
"Over the last 3 years i've tried many phones but Swift keyboard just works like charm. better than all the stock keyboards.
",5
"Trust me give it a try and you wont allow yourself to get back to the old stock keyboard.
",5
"And finally I cant explain how accurate the word predictions are as in you and your phone share some sort of telepathy powers.
",5
"Beggars belief try it now.
",5
"Needs swipe feature
",4
"More themes plz update
",1
"Been using this for years now, still, nothing comes close, but, it slipped a little in predictions.
",5
"I still maintain, If you're using the stock keyboard you're wasting time.
",5
"The keyboard doesn't learn anymore. the beauty of swiftkey was it's ability to learn your methods and style.
",1
"It doesn't do that with this update.
",1
"Always remembers everything i wrote before
",5
"I was a keypad guy before i bought a android phone, i was so frustrated by the touch keypad.but after i installed swiftkey.its like a magic.Superb App.
",5
"This keyboard has the best prediction out of the other ones I've tried.
",4
"Super easy and quick.
",4
"The only things that would make it better would be more customization options, and add Swype capability.
",4
"After new update predictions not display good.there is some problem.Please fix it
",1
"It's fast, smart, and easy to use.
",5
"Swipe left to delete words, down to minimize keyboard, and up to CAP. and i love the phone style number pad.
",5
"I'm a fast typer and this app always corrects my words!
",5
"Even if you're a precise texter the app has an option for that, and many other options.
",5
"Worth buying!
",5
"Maybe you could make it even better if you could scroll down or across more than just three predictions?
",5
"Like five or 10.
",5

",5
"What a great day.
",5
"To find such wonderful product.
",5
"When I installed the free version of the program.
",5
"I immediately bought the complete version of it.
",5
"It works so fast, easy and good that I will not change it.
",5
"In fact I recommend it to all who want to save time and energy to buy it.
",5
"Hope this will help many people like me who are wondering what to buy to help themselves in writing.
",5
"May God bless you!
",5
"I have bought very few apps, and am very stingy when buying one, but after using the trial version im pretty much sold!
",5
"If you're dyslexic or just have fat thumbs (both of which I have), this is great for texting!
",5
"Def worth 4 dollars!
",5
"Great, but u should let people know there is no emoji BEFORE they BUY IT!
",2
"Excelent software and it's a powerful and very smart and we are waiting new features  Thanks a lot
",5
"This keyboard seems to have the best prediction and auto correct.
",5
"I've used it on my evo 4G and now on my galaxy s3.
",5
"The performance wasn't as good on my evo, but it still got the job done.
",5
"The keys just didn't pop up as fast.
",5
"There are many different keyboards you can get for your android, I've tried just about all of them but this one is by far the bast.
",5
"Highly recommend!
",5
"Great keyboard, the word prediction is great, the haptic feedback is good, the only thing I wish this keyboard had is gestures typing like the new Jelly Bean keyboard has.
",5
"Absolutely awesome.
",4
"This keyboard changed my mind about typing on a touch-screen.
",4
"The only problem I have with this keyboard is that sometimes it will interpret my fast typing as a deletion swipe, which can be frustrating - but I can put up with it since my typing would take much longer without this keyboard even taking that into account.
",4
"I love the support for multiple dictionaries at the same time, works very well.
",4
"Couldn't find a better keyboard anywhere
",5
"It doesnt work with fb chat. which is the ideal situation to make use of fast typing and auto correct.
",3
"Other than that its worth the money.
",3
"This is on another level than the keyboard that came with my galaxy s3, which was terrible - the only improvement that SwiftKey needs is the ability to paste into whatsapp - to do this right now i have to switch to the Samsung keyboard and hold the 123?
",5
"Button to paste.
",5
"Aggiornando il sistema ad Android 4.2 la tastiera scompare da sola (e va reinstallata)
",2
"Very nice appp.
",5
"Works like butter on my note.
",5
"A definite download.
",5
"The keyboard layout is not to my liking and cannot be changed much.
",3
"It also learns from emails I didn't write, just replied to!
",3
"If I just press space bar many times it writes a long sentence somebody else wrote me in an email.
",3
"There is a ton if lag!
",2
"I start to type and it doesn't register until seconds later and I've already written a paragraph.
",2
"Eats a ton of RAM.
",2
"Good substitute for stock keyboard.
",4
"Buy this app
",5
"Major issues with Chrome fields.
",1
"Jumps all over the place, erases characters.
",1
"Pretty much unusable.
",1
"Literally THE BEST keyboard for Android.
",5
"I sell phones, and recommend this to all of my guests.
",5
"Saved my life.
",5
"Does great with predicting the next textual input.
",5
"It has a great look and awesome development and innovation with this keyboard.
",5
"Personally I find I type less accurately with this keyboard than the stock one.
",3
"Also don't like the numbers/characters panel.
",3
"The option to have a more classic looking one wouldn't go amiss.
",3
"Not even the stock ones.
",5
"But common in wanna see SwiftKey flow!
",5
"I would definitely recommend this product.
",5
"It's hard to say all the things that this program does so I will just say try the trial version and you might get hooked.
",5
"I've been using this app since June.
",1
"I never seen a useful update.
",1
"I posted a review telling that on Samsung Galaxy Note doesn't work very well, it keeps crashing and freezing my messaging app and whatsapp.
",1
"Sometimes I have to wait MINETES till I can use it again.
",1
"Tryed to delete it and install it again,doesn't work.
",1
"I paid almost 4 euro for this, can't be possible.
",1
"Can you make a useful update please?
",1
"Till that customers, if you have a SGN, DON'T INSTALL.
",1
"This is a great keyboard but I have found A.I. Type keyboard is faster smoother and cleaner.
",3
"This is still awesome but I've moved on.
",3
"Just does not allow for fat fingers.
",3
"Would love to move space bar right.
",3
"Good app for my note 2    ,.
",4
"I really like how easy it is to use.
",5
"I've been using this keyboard for over a year now.
",5
"It beats all of the others out hands down.
",5
"I was not happy with the keyboard after coming from iPhone to Android until i tried Swiftkey, HOWEVER, i have found quite a few apps that refuse to show the predictive text.like the built in browser on my Galaxy S3.
",3
"Not sure if it's a setting, but if it is i haven't found it yet.
",3
"It does show up in Chrome at least, but there are some other apps as well that do not seem to work.
",3
"I will like to see a swipe input (think it's coming) but i'm not 100% sold thats faster for me anyway.
",3
"(add firefox, dolphin to the list of non working browsers with predictive text).
",3
"No reply from the company to address any issues.
",3
"Half of the time it's great, but also the other half of the time I feel like throwing my very expensive phone at a wall.
",3
"It seems as though it has become worse the longer I have been using it.
",3
"This is literally the only app I've rated after owning android phones for four years.
",5
"Thanks for finally adding my particular dialect!
",5
"I previously had to make do with the Queen's English.
",5
"When ever I enter my email address the auto space messes shot up.
",3
"Lack of hand writing support for the Note 2 is a shame, will inable again when this is supported.
",3
"I love the galaxy s3, but I hate the Samsung g keyboard and how it will not auto correct for you.
",5
"All my problems have been solved with the SwiftKey.
",5
"It fits in so well with the phone, and works like a charm.
",5
"I love this app, but i would love it even more if you could turn off those silly android emoticons and if the numbers on the numbers page were at the top in a row.
",5
"Getting praise from me is hard only the.
",5
"Second time I've ever done a public comment.
",5
"But this keyboard is so accurate and word.
",5
"Prediction os freaky scary accurate.
",5
"Would like standard/more keyboard sound(s)
",4
"Best keyboard ever created!
",5
"Highly recommend to anyone who wants to make typing on their phones easy & fast.
",5
"Love this keyboard, Provides accurate and efficient typing.
",4
"The predictions are quite impressive.
",4
"More customisable themes would be excellent.
",4
"A nice dark black theme, or deep purple would be nice.
",4
"The ability to customize your colours would be sweet too.
",4
"Other than that the keyboard is very sweet.
",4
"Its a great app but recently just realized that it does drain my battery
",5
"Prediction bar disappears when turning screen on and off.
",1
"This issue is 100% reproducible.
",1
"Will update review rating once fixed.
",1
"I purchased this app a long time ago.
",1
"Typing was really fast, predictions were good, way better than the stock keyboard(s).
",1
"But since ICS and also with Jelly Bean typing is near impossible.
",1
"The whole application just halts.
",1
"Keypresses are piled up and released at once.
",1
"This leads to ""long presses"" and i get all kind of funky chars in my texts.
",1
"It's no issue with my ROMs as i've tried like 10 different versions.
",1
"RAM and CPU are good, nothing else is running, no improvements possible.
",1
"Just have a look at the bug section.
",1
"Search for ""lag"".
",1
"The best predictions of any keyboard I've ever used but very lacking in customization.
",3
"Take a page from Perfect Keyboard and fix that.
",3
"Like the character popup, it annoys me personally and runs slow on my phone anyway, so I'd actually like to turn it off because I make MORE mistakes with it on.
",3
"And the number /symbols pad drives me nuts.
",3
"Offering more alternate layouts for that would be nice.
",3
"Also a set of arrows to pad through our characters would be nice because finger insertion sucks.
",3
"This is the best keyboard I've used.
",5
"The predictive text is great and becomes more and more intuitive.
",5
"You can turn on learning from Facebook status updates, Twitter updates, and SMS message writing.
",5
"And the spacebar is wider!
",5
"No longer am I placing periods after every word!
",5
"Highly recommend.
",5
"I have definitely been typing faster since I switched to swiftkey.
",5
"The predictions are really good, and even though it takes a bit of a learning curve to use, there is no way you will want to go back once you get used to it.
",5
"Worth every penny.
",5
"Best keyboard on the market, looking forward to getting Swiftkey Flow!
",5
"I want to like this, really I do.
",2
"But between it shoving words after commas without me noticing, overly aggressive spell check and if I let it type out a sentance by just hitting space bar a lot it types out my cover letter for a job I applied for over a year ago.
",2
"Since I've purchased this a year ago I've given it a try 3 times and have always had to stop after a couple of weeks just out of frustration.
",2
"This keyboard has the best prediction of any that I've tried.
",3
"Unfortunately, it is laggy to appear and respond to input.
",3
"It also has poor app compatibility: It basically doesn't work in Firefox or Sygic.
",3
"If they could slim it down, make it snappier and improve it's compatibility it would be the best Android keyboard available.
",3
"Right now it's alternately awesome and infuriating.
",3
"I had this app for a year now I go it in 2011 for .10 cents I bought it only because it was ten cents and I never ever used it till I got a new phone and figured I'd try it out I really wish I would of used it than because this keyboard blows away the stock one and Swypes keyboard (I do like Swype also almost just as much) but this is one keyboard I can not be without now!
",5
"I was hooked in this after the first few words I type!
",5
"If it changes my word and I hit the backspace key it should automatically keep the word I typed Please fix!
",4
"This keyboard learns words and your habits at an amazing rate.
",5
"Predictions are far better than the standard ones that come on Android phones.
",5
"The only app I've ever paid for and it was well worth it.
",5
"This is a really nice keyboard and has allowed me to increase my speed a lot due to its great error corrections, but it is lacking in that it doesn't allow you to swipe.
",4
"If you could swipe to type too, I could increase my one handed typing speed significantly.
",4
"I'd be lost without SwiftKey.
",5
"Everything about the app is pretty good.
",4
"There are just 3 things I would want for improvement.
",4
"I wish the app showed you a personal dictionary of the words it ""learns"" that you use.
",4
"Somehow incorporate swype (t9 trace).
",4
"Move the 10 key number pad to the middle instead of all the way to the left of the keyboard.
",4
"Other than that, this app is fantastic.
",4
"too slow, I'll stick to anysoftkeyboard
",2
"This should be the official Android app, best Keyboard ever - worth the price!
",5
"Gave it a fair chance but just not for me.
",1
"The most efficient typing application out there.
",5
"Love the predictions and auto-corrections.
",5
"Typing is a breeze now.
",5
"Totally worth the price.
",5
"Hope it supports Chinese input soon.
",5
"This keyboard is east to use and makes typing very fast
",5
"I love using this keyboard!
",5
"I just purchase this and it wont install that really sucks .do something or give me my money back seriously

",5
"I wish I had known about this sooner it would have saved a lot of time editing all my emails.
",5
"I think it's a must have if you text or type a lot of emails on your phone.
",5
"I loved this keyboard!
",5
"I can type without putting space between the words, and it does all the work.
",5
"In addition, I can have another language running at the same time.
",5
"Also, themes are really cool, the typos correction is just amazing.
",5
"BACK WITHOUT HOLDING ANY KEY.
",5
"This app is great.
",5
"The stock keyboard doesn't come close compared to this, I like the way it learns as you type making texting quicker because the words are there just to be pressed rather than typed.
",5
"signed up for the beta. nothing
",4
"Nice app.
",5
"Great app, esp has I'm dyslexic it helped me greatly, that I bought the app from the trial, it worked fine for a few days, Just it became buggy, Not sure what happened lost the pre-text and other features.
",3
"It started to become unresponsive until it begun to type with errors etc.  I've tried to download again,It says its Installed, but it don't seem to be reaching my phone.
",3
"Like I've said I've looked all in my phone through all my apps everywhere but it appears to have gone from my phone.
",3
"Could you resend it or mail or contact me on how to get it working again?
",3
"But the Android 4.2 keyboard does it all on both tablet and phone with swipe feature built in.
",5
"I used to switch between swype and swiftkey.
",5
"And you have to buy a tablet version of swift separate from the phone.
",5
"Now I use ONE keyboard on both devices.
",5
"Need for themes!Such as iphone theme and Windows Phone theme!more themes
",5
"Been using this keyboard for quite some time on both Samsung galaxy S and galaxy note 2.

"Thank you guys keep up the good work!
",5
"Love the new themes too!
",5
"Hopefully more themes are on their way!
",5
"I had it for a really long time from the Amazon market but i bought it here because it updates faster!
",5
"Since I update my T-mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 to Jelly Bean 4.1.1 it keeps going back to stock keyboard!

"Saves me time and is accurate.
",5
"Only problem is I find the shift key is to close to the ""A"" key.
",4
"I have fat fingers and I always press shift rather than ""A.""

"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. best keyboard ever. been using it it began.
",5
"I'm using the trial keyboard, but can't miss the sale off :), buy it and waiting for Vietnamese language.
",5
"Based on my experiences, SwiftKey is the best Android keyboard that I have ever tried.
",5
"It has a great layout and it has the most intelligent word prediction It can handle up to 3 languages at the same time.
",5
"Still not perfect but the best out there by miles.
",4
"An excellent keyboard, I bought this while it was on offer and have never looked back!
",5
"I never saw the importance of having a different keyboard until I used this for the first time!
",5
"I would pay double for this now as it is invaluable!
",5
"When the new jelly bean update came out I ditched thisand tried out Google's attempt but now I've re installed what I think is this best and most accurate keyboard out there
",5
"Just need to be able to drop the keyboard once your finished otherwise really good app
",4
"Great keyboard
",5
"This is an amazing app.
",5
"The predictions are great and it correct everything even if what you typed is way off the actual word.
",5
"The skins look great and the app learns everything about how you type and the words you input the most.
",5
"Overall this is the best keyboard app on the market.
",5
"Absolutely worth the price.
",5
"I upgraded my HTC sensation 4G on t mobile & now SwiftKey sucks.
",2
"Gets stuck on entries, hold up, delay while typing, doesn't correctly read my tapping.
",2
"I just wish there were more themes.
",4
"I love the neon blue layout!
",5
"The keyboard is ridiculously smart and useful, but the lack of a variety of skins makes it dull after awhile.
",4
"I even switch to my stock keyboard once in awhile just to get a different skin while typing.
",4
"This is the best keyboard for your phone out there.
",5
"Pros:  -Predictions are very accurate  -The more you use it the more.    accurate it gets -has some nice looking themes  Cons: -not much to say, except it lacks support for Mandarin language.
",5
"But please I would like to disable the pop up letters when typing.
",5
"Like before in some themes.
",5
"I am constantly getting a pop up from swift key telling me to select input method even though it's already selected.

"Would be 5 stars otherwise.
",2
"In less than a month, my brand new touchscreen-only phone (Samsung galaxy s3) was beginning to turn me into a non-texter with all the constant typos and incorrect word predictions from the built in keyboard.
",5
"So sad :( It was easier just not to send the msg at all.

"(The physical keyboard on my old crappy phone was hard to let go of).
",5
"One day with SwiftKey and I'm texting at lightning speed again!

"Using both thumbs etc. 5-stars bc I know they're coming out w a ""swype"" function soon.
",5
"This is one of the must have apps on Android.
",5
"It makes typing on a touch screen much faster.
",5
"This keyboard is simply amazing!
",5
"Best purchase I've made so far!

"This is the only keyboard app anyone will require in an android device!
",5
"The predictions are awesome and it even picks up personal quirks in writing!
",5
"having stability issues after 4.2 update.
",4
"Have been using this daily with no problems.
",5
"Best Value app I have ever bought.
",5
"A lot better than built in keyboard and more accurate.
",5
"Apart from a couple of glitches in certain apps where the prediction bar disappears if the screen times out while the keyboard is up, which can be fixed by minimizing the keyboard and opening it back up, it's brilliant.
",4
"I'm looking forward to the next major update with Flow.
",4
"It'll be the best of both worlds; Swype like input with SwiftKey predictions.
",4
"I stuck with the Samsung keyboard for 6 months.
",5
"Hated it but I thought what could be better?
",5
"Loaded the trial on my Samsung Note and bought the full app within 15 minutes.
",5
"SwiftKey is absolutely brilliant.
",5
"This is so much better than the stock keyboard, better than Go Keyboard.
",5
"The predictions are a huge time-saver.
",5
"I rarely pay for apps, but I just bought this one.
",5
"On occasion tends to be a bit slow.
",4
"This App is great.
",5
"Definitely worth the purchase!
",5
"everyone said this app was awesome. that the keyboard would blow me out of the water and make my babies smell like roses or something. it does not. swiftkey is just another keyboard. there's nothing really that great about it. in fact, the lack of the groovy swype feature that comes stock with the galaxy s3 makes it kind of lame in comparison. i bought it because it was on sale and i figured i'd try it out. i wasted a dollar. i don't know what all the hype is about, but i went back to the stock keyboard within an hour.
",3
"EDIT: after using it a bit more, it's starting to grow on me. once it has the swipe type feature, it will probably become a 4 start product.
",3
"Really good keyboard except the . com button which makes the space bar too small and ends up with messed up searches in chrome.
",4
"Give us an option to get rid of it please.
",4
"Who types a full on address these days anyway?
",4
"Google normally guesses it before you have written it.
",4
"A must have app for your Android device.
",5
"I used this when I had an HTC phone but with a Nexus, the stock keyboard still reigns supreme.
",4
"One thing I did like about it though was the nice skins.
",4
"Very clean look.
",4
"Very good corrections and suggestions and very clever, well worth getting
",5
"Increased efficiency in typing.
",4
"Works awesome, can't go back to iOS or Samsung keyboard ever again after using SwiftKey.
",5
"It learns from how you type.
",5
"Less typing makes me feel more productive.
",5
"It does a good job of predicting the next word which means I don't have to type as much.
",5
"Some short words that I add into the dictionary such as ""de"" or ""le"" will always automatically become ""De"" and ""Le"" which is not what I want.
",3
"I have to keep converting back to small case manually, which decreased my typing speed.
",3
"After last update I noticed my phone begin to lag.
",2
"Lo and behold SwiftKey was using 34MB of RAM in the background!
",2
"I've had this for a long time because I didn't like the keyboard my phone had and it's awesome
",5
"For those of you asking about the personal dictionary.
",4
"It is built into the app.
",4
"You can delete new word entries by long pressing over the word in question.
",4
"New words are added as you enter them.
",4
"I don't believe that you delete any words in the pre-installed dictionary.
",4
"This is the only app I've ever purchased.
",5
"I had no issues with the free version.
",1
"But as soon I updated to the pro version, after every reset keyboard goes back to default keyboard.
",1
"Need a fix Asap.
",1
"Previously i used to reserve works that require excessive typing to my laptop.
",5
"But now I prefer my mob and the only reason for it is this app.
",5
"Waiting for swiftkey flow!
",5
"I loath touch screen typing usually.
",5
"But this thing is the best keyboard on Android for English at least.
",5
"I wish their were more customizable options for keys.
",5
"I use the question mark much more often.
",5
"I want it to have a dedicated key.
",5
"Keyboard locks freezes and/or locks phone up when using Firefox or Chrome.
",3
"Certainly did a good job in the keyboard.
",5
"My previous keyboard was so lag and kept skipping the backspace.
",5
"Now with swift key, everything is good.
",5
"I hated the galaxy s3 keyboard!
",5
"This is the only app ive ever bought.ever
",5
"One of the apps I can't live without
",5
"Great keyboard!
",5
"Great keyboard, much better than stock.
",5
"I lovs this keyboard.
",5
"I read the review and watched the video and now I'm loving the keyboard.
",5
"I don't regret buying this.
",5
"I purchased the full version w/o trying the free one.
",1
"Best android keyboard, plus will write gibberish for you.
",5
"Thanks again for the next few days ago by the end of this message to your basket.
",5
"The word prediction is crazy.
",5
"The whole keyboard works great.
",5
"I can't wait for the swipe ability.
",5
"bought this on my phone.
",5
"I use this version on my tablet too because it is much better than SwiftKey tablet app, which annoys me as I bought the other app too.
",5
"The beta edition for Thai has been expired.
",4
"Could you add it to any Thai peoples?
",4
"I can't type without this keyboard.!
",5
"But most of the time the punctuation key types a period and I then the one I want.
",5
"Also if the smile and erase button were switched I wouldn't accidentally type smiles when you I'm trying to erase.
",5
"This app is probably the most important one you will ever download.
",4
"I am using it to type right now and it is basically reading my mind.
",4
"This is the reason I stopped considering the iphone.
",4
"I have shown so many people this keyboard.
",4
"Update: I just got the LG Optimus G and the cursor seems to be jumping to the top of the field in the middle of sentences.
",4
"Amazing app!
",5
"Worth every cent. I will never use the stock keyboard again.
",5
"The rapid typing is impressive.
",5
"Bring on more themes.
",5
"Pro: extremely easy usability, nice layout, quick auto-correct and word prediction Con: The app automatically add a space after the comma.
",4
"Not a big deal but I press the space bar every time and it auto add the 'and' word.
",4
"I quite like SwiftKey's predictions.
",3
"The few niggles I would like to overcome is I quite regularly get '.' when I haven't wanted to end the sentence.
",3
"The 2nd part that is particularly irritating is that sometimes at the lock screen, I cannot input my password.
",3
"Still it is enough to promote me to try another keyboard.
",3
"Love this keyboard, just a couple of things.
",4
"Google Now on Jellybean typing is very very slow and sluggish, works fine with stock keyboard.
",4
"Sometimes, seemingly random, the auto-correct / predictions bar disappears but the rest of the keyboard still works.
",4
"This is annoying, to fix just press back to close the keyboard, then select typing box to bring back up.
",4
"This always fixes, very weird, not too bad though.
",4
"Cant wait for Swift key Flow!
",4
"This keyboard surpasses all others I've used, it knows what I'm saying and it learns from your typing!
",5
"It's fast, customisable and above all clever!
",5
"Got it in the sale so even happier but I'd have easily paid the full price, get the trial if you're sitting on the fence & it'll definitely sway you!
",5
"I used this keyboard for over a year and recently it has gotten very glitchy and I am uninstalling
",1
"hangs most of the time after update, i really hate it now.
",1
"GalaxyS3 It just doesn't work in any application or any browser for that matter  especially twitter.
",2
"Best keyboard I've ever used.
",5
"The only keyboard that works as promised
",5
"amazing keyboard word prediction is absolutely amazing will deff improve anyone's typing one of its few but major down falls is the customization I'm coming from thumb keyboard where you can do anything. there's no where's near enough themes or even open ended options to make the keyboard look alittle appealing a needs tokeyboard is 90 percent accurate with 10 percent aesthetics I use my keyboard all the time I shouldn't hate what I'm looking at everytime other than that down right amazing keyboard
",4
"DROID RAZR.
",1
"Constant problems typing, inserts random letters, pre-selects words I don't want, even sends texts before I'm finished.
",1
"Bought for phone look not a problem but why should I pay for tablet version just let us buyers have it inc for free after all not allthe other apps charge for installing in a second larger device
",3
"Excellent application.
",5
"Not a bad keyboard, just wish it would not auto change words sometimes.
",4
"I typed refer and it chose reference for example.
",4
"Could you add a new theme ""RED NEON"" just like the blue neon (which is great by the way).
",5
"Other than that it's an awesome keyboard!
",5
"On several occasions now I've had an alert that says there are no keyboards loaded, but when I click the alert and click Languages the keyboard is already selected.
",3
"Update: if I have no connection when the error occurs I can't use the keyboard at all!
",3
"I have been using the application for a week now.
",5
"It's way better than stock application.
",5
"My girlfriend is taiwanese and she uses my phone a lot.
",4
"Can you add traditional Chinese?
",4
"I can really type fast with this app without making any mistakes due to the auto correction.
",5
"It works like a charm.
",5
"I used to create a lot of typo but somehow it knows what I intend to type.
",5
"You will be amused by its accuracy.
",5
"Thanks its awesome.
",5
"Intelligent but not intelligent enough.
",3
"Being a person with a good vocabulary, I still find myself back spacing every few words because this keyboard is far too casual in its suggestions and predictions.
",3
"It may be good for some but not if you're looking for professional eloquence-even in your every day typing.
",3
"I would pay one dollar for this app-not four.
",3
"It's a shame that the app refund period lasts for so short a time.
",3
"This keyboard is great so far.
",3
"But can you include the use of mandrin Han Yu Pin Yin text predictions please??
",3
"It jumps around spontaneously.
",2
"I am typing and I'm in a totally different sentence for no reason.
",2
"OkCupid messages do not support predictions.
",2
"Very annoying especially when trying to flirt.
",2
"Otherwise great app.
",2
"Odli?na tipkovnica
",5
"Perfect, add more keyboard themes.
",5
"The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it'll occasionally go away while I'm typing.
",4
"It might accidentally read downward swipes when I'm typing fast.
",4
"An option to disabled certain gestures (I love the left swipe to delete entire words) would be great.
",4
"I left swiftkey for touch pal, and but found swift key more accurate, but so I am back.
",5
"I sell mobile phones for a living, I only recommend this one.
",5
"Those that try it, buy it!
",5
"predictions not working in browser, wish letter boxes were wider like iphone.
",4
"Does save a lot of strokes.
",4
"Best Keyboard on the Market
",5
"This keyboard app is very awesome because the keyboards my phone came with just sucked and made me mess up a lot, but this one, it's predicated many words I was gonna say and also has a REALLY good auto correct.
",5
"The layout and software is just so awesome and im using it to type right now.
",5
"I'm not going to lie, this is hands down insanely accurate and we'll worth the 2$, I would've paid double the amount.
",5
"Excellent keyboard app!
",5
"Do I need to purchase SwiftKey flow again?
",5
"Great product but doesn't support swedish usb or bt keyboard.
",4
"This is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars.
",4
"This app is sweet but no custom dictionary makes me wish I hadn't bought it.
",3
"I like it's ability to predict what I'm writing.
",3
"I don't like the way that it handles using different languages.
",3
"I wish there was a way to toggle between languages instead of having them integrated into one keyboard.
",3
"I love this keyboard.
",5
"This gives the best suggestions based on history.
",5
"I love this keyboard, easily the best app you could give to your phone, but the only thing that is missing from this keyboard is the ability to go between typing and swype typing.
",5
"If this was somehow integrated into this keyboard I would be a happy customer.
",5
"Keep the updates coming!
",5
"Good typing tool, but...
",4
"Hope to see an update soon.
",3
"UPDATE : something strangely not preemptive, still better than anything out there.
",4
"Great features that further improve typing efficiency.
",5
"Instead it only is active when I text.
",4
"then it would be perfect!!!
",4
"A real bummer.
",1
"Worth spending money on.
",5
"Please do something about it.
",5
"and a few bugs not worth mentiining cause i could have over looked those.
",1
"I'm constantly correctly mistakes on the native android keyboard but this one is spot on.
",5
"For the first time it feels like I can actually touch type on my phone.
",5
"There's also small key differences that make the difference such as being able to put question marks and exclamation marks without having to scroll through keyboards.
",5
"It's that good that it should be standard on all android OS releases.
",5
"Well worth the money!
",5
"Please sort it out.
",2
"Every android phone should have this!
",5
"It's just backwards the way it currently is.
",5
"Best keyboard I've tried so far - which wasn't many tbh.
",3
"Galaxy S Gingerbread 2.3.4
",3
"This keyboard is by far the best.
",5
"Far better than the native keyboard.
",5
"It will fix every error....
",5
"If you try this one you will never want to try another one!!
",5
"Three languages at once!
",5
"I love it!

",4
"It's truly magic in how well it makes predictions and gets it right every time.
",4
"Test was performed using a 500 character paragraph made up of 95% words and 5% numeric characters.
",4
"Keep in mind I've been an iOS user for 3 years, so naturally, I'm more comfortable using it.

"I had been using SwiftKey for about 10 minutes.
",4
"The title says it all.
",5
"I love this app and especially the predictive typing.
",4
"There are 3 problems which should be fixed.
",4
"Fix these and is 5 stars.
",4
"I really love this app.
",5
"I like it a lot better than the stock Samsung keyboard.
",5
"The prediction is wonderful.
",5
"It learns by how you type and remembers it.
",5
"I love my keyboard!!
",5
"I will never regret buying this.
",5
"MUST HAVE.
",5
"Better than the jelly bean keyboard I can customise the colour which I love, the more it knows me the better it is
",5
"I was nervous about installing this on my Galaxy Nexus as I thought it might be a backstep from the stock keypad.
",5
"How wrong I was,  this is the best.

",1
"so i uninstall and goto get a refund.
",1
"Not even 30 minutes...

"Recomendo a todos.
",5
"Best app downloaded so Far.
",5
"The predictions saved me a lot of time.
",5
"This is the best app on the market place hands down.
",5
"It really is sophisticated and deserves all the recognition it gets.
",5
"Removing saved words from the library is an extremely helpful feature that is probably over looked as well.
",5
"If you buy this app I guarantee you will not regret it.
",5
"Only thing left for it to do is literally read my mind and translate it into text for me.

"Really great app

",5
"And makes typing on a touch screen easier coming from someone who was used to a physical keyboard.
",5
"This made me hate my stock keyboard.
",4
"So I had to buy it!
",4
"Love this app.
",5
"I have English, German and Spanish installed as I use all three.
",5
"Other than that, it's awesome to type half an email without doing any letters.
",5
"It's smart and knows what you're going to say!
",5
"Who thought this was a good idea?
",3
"An excellent application that has a crazy ability to learn your typing habits and predict your next words.
",5
"Awesome keyboard.
",3
"It does not do this on my galaxy nexus but it does do it on my tmobile gs2 t989.
",3
"5 stars when the lag gets fixed pleaseeee
",4
"Definitely an improvement from the stock.
",5
"My Samsung galaxy 3 keyboard auto corrects stupidly.
",5
"This reads my mind.
",5
"get this app if you want to speed type and not worry about typing everything wrong
",5
"I was skeptical at first about it but I don't regret buying this at all.
",5
"After that it would be 5 stars
",3
"Love the keyboard.
",5
"Leaps and bounds better than the stock keyboard.
",5
"Worth every penny, and one of the few apps I would label as essential to anyone getting a new Android phone.
",5
"Worth to be one the top paid app.
",5
"Tried to go back to the standard android keyboard and I realized I didn't know how good this one was until it was gone.
",5
"Amazing app!!
",5
"Worth every cent.
",5
"I will never use the stock keyboard again.
",5
"The rapid typing is impressive.
",5
"Apparently this app has saved me 300 keystrokes in 5 minutes of typing.
",5
"Even if this might be over-singing praises, thanks to this app the typing experience on Android just became fun and painless.
",5

",5
"I just switched from the iphone to the samsung, and the keyboard was driving me crazy.
",5

",5
"I just downloaded this app yesterday and I am super impressed with it.
",5
"The spell check is amazing.
",5
"The predictive text is uncanny and saves me more time than I can count.
",5
"An outstanding and indispensable app, worth far more than the cost!

",4
"I can even mix languages within a single sentence, like when using names of people or stores, and it works.

"I'm missing the swipe function.
",3
"This keyboard saved me time and tons of typos.
",5
"love this app it is so cleaver, keep it up Swiftkey!!!!!
",5
"I've had this app now for three years and it just gets better and better, although I purchased it as just SwiftKey they have never changed me for any updates and now obviously it's SwiftKey 3, it saves you so much time as it knows what you're typing because it gets use to the way you type and predicts the next words, just the best by far.
",5
"Used it for almost 2 years
",5
"I have loved using swift key and even payed for the upgrade just to support them.
",1
"In a word..brilliant!
",5
"Without that I don't use this app.
",3
"Went back to the Samsung keyboard in a matter of minutes.
",3
"The predictive texting for rapid texters is close to perfection.
",5
"Good job.
",5
"Keep it coming.
",5
"Absolutely brilliant
",5
"An android must have.
",5
"BUT since upgrading to swift 3 the awesome app is back in use again!
",5
"THANK GOD!
",5

",5

",5
"Lol no complaints this way,  great job...
",5
"A must have for touch screen :)
",5
"Tried this before - wasn't that good.
",5
"Tried it again, and it's amazing!
",5
"Not sure what's different this time round, but the speed and accuracy of the auto correct leaves everything else in the dust.
",5
"I literally can't fault this, well done.
",5
"I had this app at 5 stars.
",3
"It was perfect before!
",3
"Please change back.
",3
"This is from someone that would praise this app to everyone I meet.
",3
"I normally would not pay this much for an application but this is definitely one of the better keyboards.
",5
"It's so accurate its crazy i love it!
",5
"Love the keyboard.
",4
"The prediction is amazing!
",4
"It just doesn't quite measure up to Smart Keyboard.
",4
"Couldn't ask for a better keyboard.
",5
"I really like the feel of it and the different themes.
",5
"Totally worth the money!
",5
"Other than that,  its a great keyboard.  (as you notice,  there's a few double spaces in this review.)
",3
"Without doubt, the best keyboard so far..
",5
"I live everything aboutthis app, missed it a LOT when I didn't have my EVO 4G
",5
"I am a beautiful person.
",5

",5
"I am a beautiful person.
",5
"It make life so much easier when you can type and not have to keep going back over to check if your text is all spelt cirrectly.
",5
"Favorite keyboard
",4
"Like the way it's steadily improving...
",4
"Sensible design, beautifully executed.
",5
"I've had 3 android devices and 3 iOS devices and I've never come across a keyboard like this.
",5
"I can't believe I havnt got this before.
",5
"But it's not sufficiently better than the stock Jelly Bean keyboard to warrant its price.
",4
"This has been the best keyboard I have used!
",4
"With the S3 in portrait, I can actually type!
",4
"Also the hold touch for punctuation and the smileys is amazing!
",4
"Samsung Galaxy S3 model - SGH 1747M small nuisance, will give 5 stars when fixed
",4
"This keyboard is amazing.
",5
"I've never mistyped a word.
",5
"Much faster than t9 trace.
",5
"Please do this I've asked three times and I haven't got anything.
",2
"I will rate 5 star since this is added.
",2
"That's the only gripe I have about SwiftKey.
",4
"Other than that, Flawless.
",4
"Best keyboard for any droid phone!
",5
"Predictive text works intermittently in apps.
",1
"No longer remembers sentences or predicts hashtags.
",1
"This is a harsh review.
",1
"Other keyboards r having a alot of features.
",1
"I love this application.
",5
"Neon keyboard is the best!
",5
"Used to be the best keyboard out there.
",1
"Go support a keyboard that will focus on what users actually want and fix bugs in a timely fashion.
",1
"Didn't quite understand why people needed extra keyboards since I found the default ones fine but SwiftKey is actually really precise.
",5
"Fix this, get five stars.
",1
"Now to be fair, if I missed these options somewhere in the settings, please tell me, if not, it would be quite helpful to update it.
",4
"Overall, excellent keyboard and love the different themes.
",4
"The only keyboard anyone will need with a android phone
",5
"This is seriously amazing.
",5
"I am typing this on it and it almost always predicts the next word with only a few key strokes.
",5
"I love it swype has nothing on swift key 3.
",5
"I absolutely love this keyboard, an amazing replacement for the awful stock.
",4
"Seems a bit steep, amazing otherwise.
",4
"It is Amazing, I recommend!
",5
"Worth the money!
",5
"I love my new Samsung galaxy S3!
",5
"Even worse when you have two or three languages,  you need to keep switching all that time :-(
",5
"For only $0.99! You can solve all your problems ;-)!
",5
"Simple to use, SwiftKey 3 is a huge surprise to me.
",5
"It works perfectly using two languages at the same time without switching to one to another...  ;-)
",5
"Regardless of whether this is a developer issue or Google issue, it's unacceptable in a paid app.
",1
"Please hurry up and fix it!
",1
"Dictionary remembers singlish as well like leh, lah, lor.
",5
"Good buy!
",5
"Got this for pennies when it was on offer and would easily have paid full price for it.
",5
"Really good and totally customizable so do spend a minute or two setting it up to suit your needs.
",5
"Hated my touch screen phone till i put this app on and now i'm very well impressed and love my we Galaxy Y
",5
"Saves a substantial number of keystrokes.
",5
"Really works well.
",5
"Works perfectly
",5
"I've recently switched from iphones to Android, I've been blown away by the jelly bean os and have realised apple give you a fraction of the useabilty of the system.
",5
"BUT the standard keyboard on jelly bean really sucks in so far as auto correcting your inputting.
",5
"2.99 is a bargain for the ease of typing that I'm used to.
",5
"I was always a blackberry person, and I have changed to more powerful smart phones for lots of reasons,  but the one thing I missed was the key board on blackberry, and I have tried lots of key pad apps but this is the best  and nearest to my blackberry experience for sure, great job
",5
"I've only been using it for a few minutes now but I've never typed this fast on any phone before.
",5
"I love how I can have it detect three languages at any time.
",5
"Money well spent.
",5
"Better than stock keyboard, love it. Lots of customization but would like to see more.
",5
"And was convinced.
",5
"A genuine marvel at what it does.
",5
"Quick prediction and great support for arabic
",5
"It's definitely worth purchasing and using.
",5
"Much much better than the factory android keyboard that came with my S3.
",4
"I still find it much worse than my iPhone was.
",4
"I purely base my opinions on how often I have to go back and fix mistakes that either I've made and it didn't fix.  or words it just completely butcher's.
",4
"I'm not basing my opinion off gimmicky things that the keyboards can do.
",4
"Texting is so much easier and accurate with the word selection choices and the app's ability to learn frequently used words.
",5
"Once I figured it out.....
",5
"You can set it to suggest-- but it doesn't override what you type in if you choose that option.
",5
"Will 5 star again when fixed.
",1
"Simply does an amazing job
",5
"This is without doubt one of (if not) the best keyboards available today.
",3
"That's also the reason I also purchased Thumb Keyboard and is writing this review on that keyboard.
",3
"Works so well you hardly notice what it's doing, which is exactly what you want with a keyboard.
",5
"Prediction is great and different themes are good.
",5
"This is how stock keyboards should work, Samsung and the likes take note should be standard on all phones.
",5
"A separate tablet app I have to purchase in addition to regular SwiftKey?
",5
"wow its like it knows what i am about to wrote before i even write it .
",5
"saves me so much time and effort .
",5
"well worth the price it is now but for 25p it was a steal .
",5
"only have one complaint...
",4
"that being said..
",4
"this keyboard setup and functions kicks
",4
"works fine for me
",4
"Other than that.
",3
"Great keyboard!
",4
"This is the best keyboard app ever it is so easy!
",5
"Once this behavior is fixed I can adjust my rating to five stars - how hard would it be to create an option to disable this behavior?
",1
"This is one of those apps that I will never not have on an Android device.
",5
"It allows you to type so much faster and easier -
",5
"Now I feel that I must.
",5
"More important is that we all use the smart phone keyboard more than anything else.
",5
"Can't believe how advanced swift has made it.
",5
"When I first got my Samsung Galaxy II, I hated the keyboard that was on it.
",5
"Soon after, I downloaded SwiftKey 3 and I cannot use anything else! I love it!
",5
"I recommend it 100%
",5
"By far the best keyboard out there.
",5
"Anyone agree?
",5
"I love it so much.
",5
"I after switching over from iphone to android I hate to say it, but I missed auto correct.
",5
"No android has proven once again why I am glad I switch.
",5
"SwiftKey is amazing and worth every penny.
",5
"Works even better then apple....
",5
"This as my default any more.
",5
"Best keyboard there is !!!
",5
"This app is far by the best app to get for your mobile phone.
",5
"I myself like the neon theme because it looks cool.
",5
"please fix.
",4
"Wow is all I can say.
",5
"Otherwise fantastic.
",3
"But this keyboard is more stable and consistent.
",4
"There isn't a better predictive keyboard!
",5
"I don't buy apps but I bought this one!
",5
"Highly recommend for only four dollars. :-)
",5
"Love this app
",5
"The best keyboard app there is and keeps getting better with each update!
",5
"I don't even have to type any more.
",5
"Best 99 cents I ever spent.
",5
"This app is for people who would like to replace their terrible keyboards.
",5
"Don't be cheap.
",5
"This is one app that I can honestly say is worth my money.
",5
"Which is the only reason why I decided to purchase SwiftKey 3 from Google play.
",5
"Way better than the default keyboard!
",5
"My favorite option is changing the amount of time for long press since I use the secondary keys a lot.
",5
"Use to love it.
",3
"3 stars it is for now.
",3
"Switching to factory keyboard.
",3
"Been using it for more than 3 months, it should have learned my personal lexico by now.
",3
"Get it if only $ .99, else I can't recommend it.
",3
"Keyboard layout is marginally better.
",3
"Really amazing predictive text.
",4
"I am revising my review to reflect that the problems I had were fixed.
",5
"This is my favorite keyboard.
",5
"It's a small problem that shouldn't take away from how well the auto-correct and predictions work.
",5
"This is the best keyboard I have ever used it is the perfect keyboard
",5
"I asked for fix good while ago with no update on it.
",4
"It made my transition to a touch screen a lot easier.
",5
"Great Keyboard with excellent predictions and auto correction...really swift.
",5
"I've been using it for a long time and love it.
",5
"We'll see!
",5
"Use smart keyboard pro and this, SwiftKey is so intuitive and easy to use i am tending to stay with it.
",5
"Completey customizable very efficient works exactly like a keyboard should work very fast and I know because I'm an English major who uses Google drive alot for papers and homework.
",5
"Best keyboard out there.
",4
"Blazing fast, error free.
",4
"I used the trial for a month and felt it was so much better than my original keyboard.
",5
"Unfortunately I got used to how great Swiftkey was quickly and then my trial was over.
",5
"I switched back to my original android keyboard with auto-correct and my typing went from great to horrible.
",5
"Swiftkey should be thanked, they're saving lives with their app because people who might have a crash from texting now can be relieved with reliable text suggestions.
",5
"People need to stop whining, they're great.
",5
"I bought this app much earlier with my nexus 7.
",3
"I then I realized that there was a tablet version.
",3
"Is there any difference?
",3
"Motorola Defy rooted with CM9 ROM by jordan installed.
",4
"Works great.
",4
"Saves me so much time and effort with its super smart spell correction and prediction text.
",5
"Great app.
",5
"Makes it possible to write on touchscreen without taking ages, it's SO helpful!
",5
"Definitely one of my favourite apps!

",5
"I don't have to worry about making mistakes because it will always fix hit!
",5
"Highly recommend!
",5
"This keyboard is really good.
",4
"Until this feature is added,  my rating will stay at 4
",4
"I seriously hated the stock keyboard on my samsung galaxy s3 it was horrible and I couldn't type on it fast at all.
",5
"I then got swift and I love it soo much well worth the money, and it makes my phone even that better.
",5
"I know this is an old phone but still No improvement.
",1
"It is way better than the Android keyboard!
",5
"The auto correct is amazing and so accurate!
",5
"First review I've bothered to do -
",5
"getting this app genuinely makes my life easier.
",5
"Much faster sending long emails and the predictive element is awesome.
",5
"Tryed to send them an email they said search for problem thread or sth like that .
",2
"I have no time for it 2 stars and uninstalling .. waist of money..
",2
"It works when I text that's all
",2
"Cept for that this is my favorite keyboard.
",4
"Better than Swipeit keyboard.
",4
"When I had a Casio commando, this app was great.
",3
"Not good.
",4
"Please fix.
",4
"I've downloaded what feels like a dozen keyboards and all of them just weren't quite right.
",5
"This one on the other hand has absolutely excellent predictive text and a great keyboard layout that makes typing easier so I hit the right letter the first time.
",5
"The developer does not seem to address the issue.
",2
"It needs fixing in the first place.
",2
"This is really good and 98% accurate since I'm a rapid typer..
",4
"Thank god for android sale I bought it at ard sgd1+ awesome!
",4
"I would gv it 5 stars!

"I this is on s3.
",4
"Unfortunately, it took me a while before trying it out and I cannot get a refund now.
",1
"Does not work.
",1
"I've used it before and it's a great app.
",1
"Might be a jellybean thing.
",1
"Seriously everyone who don't have this buy it, it's soo worth it!
",5
"One of the best apps ever
",5
"I have owned 5 smart phones and without question this is the best keyboard I have ever used.
",5
"Well done, devs.
",5
"The keyboard works very well!
",5
"It is intelligent enough to really learn what im saying and how I say it.
",5
"I'm gonna un install it..
",2
"Ok amazing app I love this look try it it will plow your mind..

",4
"Quite amazing.
",4
"Hence only 4 stars.
",4
"This really does learn and saves me loads of time.
",4
"It's easier to write on this keyboard than on full computer one.
",5
"It remembers how you write and after some time of usage it automagically suggests and complete your words and sentences.
",5
"I and everyone I told about this keyboard loves it.
",5
"Great,  only need to type about 15 characters for this sentence :-)
",5
"Took the trial didn't upgrade for a week decided I couldn't live without it!
",5
"You'll understand why when you stop being tight lol.
",5
"Honestly though this is amazing.
",5
"Best keyboard on the market to date.
",5
"Great predictions, good looks, handy gestures, you'll be hard pressed to find a keyboard that does this better than swift key
",5
"By far, a must need.
",5
"This keyboard allows me to type like I was on an iPhone (which is still garbage)
",5
"Made typing much easier.
",4
"I have had a smartphone since they first came out and this is the first app I have ever paid for.
",4
"Well worth the money!
",4
"It's not swype so I'm not sure why everyone wants that?
",4
"Get swype or a knock off if you want it and your standard keyboard doesn't have it.
",4
"There are maybe 2 that are nice, the rest look really cheap.
",4
"And even the good ones could be better.
",4
"In terms of functionality, it's exceptional.
",4
"I love this keyboard the best of all the ones I have tried.
",5
"It is amazing just try and see.
",5
"Best software keyboard I have ever used.
",5
"Built for me.
",5

",5
"I had no idea a different keyboard could make such a difference.

",5
"Its super fast and efficient.
",5
"Which is perfect because im such a lazy fast  texter.
",5
"I miss almost every letter but... BAM!
",5
"swiftkeys got my back!
",5
"Best keyboard ever! (Galaxy S III)
",5
"One word: Download
",5
"Very annoying.
",1
"I no longer use this keyboard as a result.
",1
"Otherwise the predictive text is better than the built in one on my Gs2.
",1
"Test and test after resting
",4
"After trying them all this is hands down the best keyboard.
",5
"The prediction is scarily accurate and it picks up all my mistakes - perfect for speed texters.
",5
"Was supposed to be to celebrate the 25 billion downloads from the Google play store.
",1
"I've been charged 2.99.
",1
"Would never have paid full price willingly!
",1
"I love this keyboard nuff said
",5
"Great app!
",4
"Other than that, I think this app is amazing
",4
"I even bought the keyboard after the trial expired and I NEVER buy apps!
",5

"This app beats the stock app and even the go keyboard....
",4
"Great keyboard so far ;-)
",4
"I am thoroughly impressed.
",5
"I love this app best keyboard ever.
",5
"I noticed a lot of complaints about it not having a customized dictionary, it does all you have to do is high light the word you want to add and click on it a drop down menu will appear from there click add to dictionary you can remove things as well
",5
"This is simply the best keyboard for Android.
",5
"I got my Galaxy S3 recently and was worried about not having a physical keyboard, and but with this app, my typing speed and accuracy is almost same as having a physical keyboard!
",5
"No more frustration and bunch of typos.
",5
"I switch to it when I know I'm going to do a lot of one handed typing.
",5
"I have tried thumb but Swift is the current champ.
",5
"his input ape is the best keyboard I have ever had.
",5
"It is so amazing you just might find yourself texting and sending emails just for the simple fact that is so so so easy and fun.
",5
"I the best things come in 333's :-D
",5
"This app is missing one thing..
",4
"Stock Android keyboard already beat iOS' easily. (with gesture typing etc)
",5
"it is King of any features that any SMS app has out there.
",5
"Best keyboard ever!!!
",5
"First appeared I have ever bought, it is that good.
",5
"No complaints from me.
",5
"Very pleased
",5
"Perfectly fits your each touch on the keys and knows what word you're about to say!
",5
"Found the stock keyboard on my s3 to suck.
",5
"Nearly same speed too.
",5
"Crazy fast and accurate
",5
"The way it suggests words and phrases is fantastic.
",5
"Highly recommended
",5
"That just makes it unusable..
",1
"one of the better investment I made.
",4
"A good keyboard dbhas an uncanny ability to predict next words.
",4
"The most amazing keyboard I've used ever, and I've used windows mobile for ages.
",5
"Nothing compares.
",5
"This is best keyboard I have ever used.
",5
"Predictive text tends to be spot on.
",5
"Many use a combination of Welsh and Eng in sentences
",5
"We r waiting for 5.
",4
"On my new note 2. :-)
",5
"I have never experienced such speed on a cellphone in my life before I tried SwiftKey.
",5
"It's prediction is borderline frightening with it's accuracy and it's like it's tapped into my mind.
",5
"Sometimes I just stop trying and hit in rough estimations, and it still pulls it off.
",5
"Just now I tried out writing something really dumb to get ""repair"" and it autocorrected me from twpauf :p
",5
"Try out swiftkey, you won't regret it!
",5
"100x better than  the default keyboard
",5
"Best app, they should just give it to you when you buy any android phone.
",5
"Just what i was looking for...
",5
"I can't find it!!!
",5
"Other then that great app!
",4
"Accurate predictions, customizable, easy to set up, visually appealing.
",5
"Makes typing on a touchscreen so great because I hateee it (even though I have a S3 haha)
",5
"First app I bought, no regrets as of now.
",5
"For some reason, I can't finish the install but the keyboard works fine but I think it's because it saved my setting from when I used the trial version.
",5
"The predictions wow me every time.
",2
"Definitely try it, it's worth your time.
",2
"I can text so much faster with out it.
",4
"I really would love that.
",4
"Please please please see this.
",4
"Best keyboard ever.
",5
"I'm so used to slide to delete function that even if I try to use another keyboard I'll be swiping it to delete words lol...
",5
"After trying several apps this one is the absolute best!!
",4
"I even purchased the full version :-)
",4
"This is the only keyboard that kept me coming back.
",5
"But I eventually got used to it.
",5
"I've tried quite a few different keyboard apps and this one is the best.
",5
"I love the size of the keys, the spacing between keys, and the app's ability to predict text and correct spelling and spacing errors as you go.
",5
"It also has been offering more personalization options in terms of colors etc.
",5
"Cool app
",5
"Shame, it was my favourite keyboard.
",2
"I'm searching for a keyboard like this for years.
",5
"Every Android user most have this keyboard.
",5
"You guys do the best job.
",5
"Kudos for this lesson of how a keyboard must be.
",5
"Every body start downloading this keyboard and pay for it and help this guys continuing developing this awesome product!!
",5
"You make my year!!
",5
"Simply Awesome!!!!!!!
",5
"I haven't found a better one and I truly doubt a better one exists out there.
",5
"please check
",5
"OMG this sucks compared to Smart Keyboard.
",1
"Used swiftkey for 3 weeks and I found so many bugs!!!
",1
"Developer never answered my mails.
",1
"I tried to uninstall it and reinstalling it, but it still does the same.
",5
"since updating to jelly bean 4.1.2, no more problem.
",5
"This is by far the best keyboard you can use on an Android phone.
",5
"Just something to watch out for and another reason to keep the cord handy lol
",5
"How do I get a refund?
",5
"Love using it every day.
",5
"Its prediction is amazing.
",5
"Please fix horrible programming.
",3
"Save on RSI too!
",5
"Need to fix that!
",3
"This didn't even work right and was a total waste of money.
",1
"The best approach ever!!
",5
"Life changer app.
",4
"Worth the 3.99
",4
"So close to being 5 stars!
",4
"I like how it vibrates, it makes it feel like you're pressing a button instead of a touchscreen.
",5
"Also, it saves me a lot of typos and looks cool too.
",4
"This app makes typing on my phone a joy and I can't recommend it enough.
",5
"Excellent keyboard!
",5
"This is much better than the original on my s3!
",5
"Well worth the four bucks!!
",5
"The trial period ended and I couldn't cope without buying it.
",5
"it's like it can read your mind.
",5
"definitely recommend it.
",5
"Works a LOT better in ICS than in Gingerbread.
",5
"What does it say about me that my favourite app is a keyboard?
",5
"I don't care.
",5
"The app is phenomenal.
",5
"great app, five stars
",5
"Amazing app!!! , I have been using it for a long time, typing is easy and fast!
",5
"Worked fine for a while, but some update broke it completely for me.
",2
"Thumbs down.
",2
"I use this on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with the voice recognition and it works brilliantly.
",5
"The voice recognition has a about an 85-90% accuracy and this app fixes the remaining 10%.
",5
"I'm guessing this app helps me write 3x -5x faster than what i normally would (along with all my corrections as prefer not to abbreviate).
",5
"Well worth the money.
",5
"I'm amazed how well it predicts what comes next (my friend says the app is reading my mind!), I'm guessing this type of app will be the future of typing on smart phones.
",5
"Easy to use and comparatively very fast...
",5
"If you do much typing, it is well worth the minimal expense.
",5
"half the people here in seoul use the 3x4 and other half uses qwerty.
",3
"Just purchased the app and I'm loving It already.
",5
"It's a relief since my phone is Korean and I had trouble using Spanish my native language....
",5
"Totally recommend this
",5
"Please fix.
",4
"I love the word prediction.
",5
"Best keyboard to me though.
",5
"I love SwiftKey, and I only have had it for five minutes.
",5
"1 star until fixed, I paid good money for this app.
",1
"It was so smooth on gingerbread and I don't know what happened because no other keyboard lags.
",3
"But because the other ones don't lag I'm using something else now.
",3
"I want to be back on swiftkey, please roll out a fix.
",3
"awesome keyboard, very smart.
",5
"Worried now that my credit card info has been stolen
",4
"Had the trial version and upgraded to the next.
",5
"After having this app for a month, it has saved me a vast amount of time from correcting my errors with its intelligent auto corrector and word prediction..
",5
"Worth the 5 stars
",5
"The predictive text works amazingly well.
",5
"I also like the combination of multiple languages that use the same alphabet.
",5
"Good work!
",5
"The best keyboard and text  prediction ever!!!
",5
"Hope to see new updates soon!
",5
"I prefer Thumb Keyboard much more than this.
",3
"Landscape typing is far more effective on Thumb Keyboard when using the split keyboard over the mashed together keyboard found in Swiftkey & default android keyboards.
",5
"Soooo worth $3.99 of u text often you will LOVE this too.
",5
"Love this product.
",5
"Samsung's default keyboard was too slow to keep up with my fast/rapid typing!
",5
"This one keeps up with it and has better correction ability!!
",5
"Greatest thing ever.
",5
"Really frustrating.
",3
"The best keyboard I have seen.
",5
"Highly recommended.
",5
"Much better than previous versions.
",5
"Exceeded my expectations.
",5
"Well done!
",5
"App is excellent and has great functionality.
",5
"I have tried several keyboards but none of them really met my standards when it came to accuracy.. but swiftkey has exceeded them!!!
",5
"It's amazing!
",5
"Typing hasn't been easier, better then the iphone keyboard which I thought was one of their strong suits
",5
"This has improved my typing immensely.
",4
"Can't wait for the new keyboard to launch.
",5
"Very nice app.
",5
"Takes a minute a little bit to get used to, but once it learns you and your method of typing...
",5
"I thank the SwiftKey team for developing such a great app.
",5
"SwiftKey has saved me from typing errors all the way to sentence correction.
",5
"Thank again and keep up the good work.
",5
"Nothing but the best!
",5
"Can't wait for SwiftKey Flow either!
",5
"I signed up as a Beta tester, hoping to get access soon
",5
"Great prediction.
",5
"Love this app!
",5
"I know you can do;-)
",2
"Prediction is the best of any keyboard ive used.
",5
"Predicts words the way i use them.
",5
"Worth every penny.
",5
"It's like I've got a new phone! :-$
",4
"And thus made typing on it so much more enjoyable I am looking forward for the new flow version of it
",5
"This is by far the best keyboard I have ever used on a touchscreen.
",5
"It very nearly makes up for not having a physical keyboard.
",5
"Super app.
",4
"This is a super awesome keyboard, the best estimate...
",5
"Makes typing quick and easy.
",5
"Great, the best for sure.
",5
"SwiftKey has far surpassed smart keyboard, perfect keyboard, slide it, and swype.
",5
"I really enjoy this app.
",5
"It makes typing just as fast as swipe texting but way more accurate.
",5
"This is the best keyboard I've used so far.
",4
"So until then I will give it 4 stars.
",4
"So no 5 stars until then.
",3
"This keyboard is awesome.
",5
"Works so good. (UPDATE)
",5
"Wish I had installed it a year ago.
",5
"First app i ever paid for.
",5
"Well worth it.
",5
"I hated the Samsung keyboard and went looking for a replacement.
",5
"When I sore the price tag of SwiftKey I was like how can a simple keyboard be worth $4.
",5
"It literally corrects every single mistake after it learns your writing style.
",5
"Very helpful for work emails as I no longer appear unprofessional when I press send without Proof reading.
",5
"Worth every cent and more.
",5
"This is the best tap style keyboard and it lets you use Google's voice dictation software which is better than Dragon, which Swype forces you to use.
",5
"The features are amazing.
",5
"And even when I miss the space bar.
",5
"The best keyboard ever.
",5
"This is the best android keyboard period, I wish my computer keyboard working like this  keyboard
",5
"It was the best keyboard out their.
",5
"Please fix that and I'll give you the 5 stars.
",5
"10/23/12 just down graded to 3 stars not working good on my DROID charge.
",5
"So good it is the only app I paid for!
",5
"Wished I had switched to this keyboard a long time ago!
",5
"Not buying anymore products of this devs.
",1
"Eagerly awaiting SwiftKey Flow in Q1 2013!
",5
"For that I will rate 4 stars, but it truly has 5 star potential.
",4
"Dev knows but hasn't provided a solution
",2
"This is the 1st app I've ever paid for & it's excellent!
",5
"I used Swype for over a year.
",5
"I used the normal phone keyboard & it felt rubbish.
",5
"Then I bought Swype, after reading lots of reviews, & it is great to use.
",5
"I have never used Swype since!
",5
"The predicted text is just brilliant at guessing your next words & it truly makes typing faster.
",5
"There's No Other Like It!
",5
"I highly recommend this.
",5
"Most intuitive keyboard I've used EVER!
",5
"This keyboard makes typing a breeze.
",5
"I'm a fast typer normally but I can almost keep up using the suggestions.
",5
"Great predictive word keyboard, barely have to type when I text.
",5
"Solved all my issues with stock Android keyboard.
",5
"Just great!
",5
"I love that it can learn words that I use automatically from sms and Gmail.
",5
"It knows me better than I do..
",5
"5 stars for being the best keyboard I've used!
",5
"One of the best keyboards around.
",3
"Smooth, fast, and epically accurate in prediction.
",3
"Auto correct is amazingggg
",5
"Near perfect.
",3
"But something has changed in the context word guessing in the past few weeks that has made it just an average keyboard.
",3
"I thought it would be just ok, the more I use this app the less I have to punch these little keys.
",5
"Heck, over half of this review was done using the space bar after punching in a few keys!
",5
"Absolutely love this, best piece of tech for andro out :-)
",5
"Simple stuff like that.
",5
"I it's really annoying on my s3.
",2
"Not even going to lie, I've been using this for just over a month and I got to say it's probably the best app I've ever downloaded, the keyboard is really smooth and auto correct is a amazing
",5
"Exceeded my expectations!
",5
"My sentence is ""I am shutting off all the time.
",5
"There should be such a basic bug in such a famous app.
",3
"A great app otherwise!
",3
"This key board is awesome!
",5
"It makes texting a breeze.
",5
"Thanks SwiftKey, you saved half of an important note!
",5
"But can I remove the icon from the notification bar when I am typing?
",5
"The keyboard should work automatically with everything in your mobile, JUST WASTE OF MONEY and SPACE!
",1
"U have to run the App in order to use that, it doesnt even worth a penny!
",1
"Ask you guys first read all the comments and reviews here and then download or get dumbed!
",1
"Way better than the keyboard that came with the phone.
",5
"You have to install it..
",5
"I owned a Moto Defy and the screen size is not as big as others, but Swiftkey does an excellent job on it!
",5
"Deadly love it and would like to recommend to any Android user.
",5
"I was skeptical to purchase this app because I wasn't sure it would live up to its hype.
",5
"But I was wrong, I would rather not use the default keyboard as it has made me move quickly when texting.
",5
"If you're a huge texter, buy this app, don't even think about it.
",5
"This app is well worth it.
",5
"Run, don't walk to the app store to purchase it!
",5
"Besides it not being that much different than the free version, it's pretty good.
",4
"I loved this keyboard, but I struggle to find something worthy that was added.
",3
"Why would you remove features???
",3
"Now that you can use native ICS voice to text I'm back on board with this keyboard.
",4
"Best keyboard on the market.
",4
"The longer you use it, the smarter it gets.
",4
"Learns how you type in context which gives predictions like no other.
",4
"Thanks swiftkey
",5
"(2) would like a way to shift-lock the number &  symbol keys of the main keyboard.
",4
"Constantly stuck with small font on keys.
",1
"One request, as others have said, would be to be able to change the number pad to a pc layout.
",5
"On the phone I still find its a bit small to use.
",4
"If phone keypad was included as a layout, it would combine speed with advanced prediction.
",4
"Please put this letters on a long press for croatian input, keys are toooooo small.
",3
"It really needs more themes.
",4
"A nice black and red one in particular, similar to the neon but red instead of blue.
",4
"Five stars for more themes.
",4
"Wish more themes were available tho.
",4
"Please add a setting to remove word suggestions when using my hard keyboard.
",2
"When is more themes coming
",3
"Would make reading texts easier without dragging down to close the keyboard.
",4
"One thing I would love to have would be shortcuts.
",4
"Absolutely love this keyboard, my only wishing is it would be cool if there was a dedicated row for numbers..
",4
"Best kb app available, I doubt most other themes are very popular(?) so should be removed, Cobalt is my fav, Dark would be better if the green was changed to match ICS blue theme similar to Cobalt, but that's just my opinion so well deserved 5 stars!
",5
"If you added Mandarin,  it would be perfect.
",5
"More themes would be better
",5
"If only it didn't become disabled every time I plug my phone in..
",1
"It needs more customization, updates, and a user dictionary.
",1
"But in Romanian predictions are not even close to those in English..
",5
"It would be great an update of romanian dictionary.
",5
"And it would be good to learn email addresses too.
",5
"If only they would add handwriting recognition...
",4
"and the backup is the most important thing that they should think about it.
",2
"Please give us the option to remove the smiley button and replace it with a return key
",4
"It would be nice if the keyboard would have better smiley faces or imoticons the ones it has now are so boring then I would absolutely rate it a 5.
",3
"It can even learn from Facebook, Gmail, and twitter.
",5
"Keyboard was great but the killed the prediction accuracy with tweaks in the latest update.
",1
"Would like to change a setting so that when I press the full stop, it doesn't automatically add a space.
",4
"Please allow whatsapp personalization!
",3
"It's perfect for English, however I am looking forward to more improvements of other languages. (Also using Russian)
",5
"It does not even include Chinese language.
",1
"But I wish you could tell it to default to one language.
",5
"The layout of the number keys is really dumb.
",3
"They should be horizontal but they're all clumped together on the left.
",3
"Works awesome can't wait for more themes.
",5
"Needs more settings so I can personalize the keyboard.
",3
"Bring on more themes.
",5
"Restarts my phone.
",1
"Great keyboard,  just wish there were more color customizations for the keyboard settings.
",4
"It just won't let me use dots on text views.
",4
"The only thing it needs desperately is a different sound theme, because the old typewriter one is pathetic.
",4
"But the last three days  it hasnt worked because it cant download the english language pack!
",1
"I like the multi-character key concept, for popular punctuation marks, and I would like to suggest more, a selection of quotation marks, right facing-left facing, possibly standard, and elaborate as standards allow.
",4
"Perfect if support Chinese input
",4
"I like it would love it if it had swipe option though
",4
"It's a really good keyboard, however I feel like there needs to be more themes.
",4
"Probably you can remove the auto-cap for the suggestions portion because it is kinda irritating to have an upper case word in the middle of the sentence.
",5
"Where is the swype feature?
",3
"Wish you guys would add the Japanese support, much needed.
",4
"Please make it an option to have pop up keys.
",2
"Yes, they put a few new themes in since the last iteration, but it could really benefit from the keyboard skin selection already out on the Android Market.
",4
"Predictive text doesn't work in browser.
",1
"Needs word competition point option.
",1
"Excellent before update to ICS.
",1
"The keyboard layout cannot be modified to suit the user, thus the odd placement of numbers, symbols, and other buttons become frustrating to try to adjust to.
",1
"Take the numbers: usually lined up across the top after you press the ""123"" button, but not here.
",1
"Instead you get the numbers displayed as if you were holding a blackberry.
",1
"Other issues are the lack of a user dictionary and the overaggressive autocorrect omitting words.
",1
"it repeats the download process from the beginning every time the screen goes off.
",1
"a headache if your connection is slow like mine.
",1
"was expecting more features.
",1
"This keyboard has not got much features.
",1
"No calibration option makes it a current poor choice for those running the latest and greatest OS.
",3
"Better than the original keys, would be better if you could customize the positions and sizes of the keys and remove some of the un used ones,  and I would like to end this review if could put the keyboard back down cos the keyboard is hiding the post buttons in portrait mode.
",3
"If it had swype capability it would be worth the money I paid.
",3
"I decided not to use it after one day of frustration without Swype...
",3
"Just wish there was a Japanese language pack and more themes.
",5
"2. Please make the "".com"" button on the space bar while on the Web an option, because personally, it gets in the way A LOT.
",4
"I really want a dedicated quotation mark button, and more themes.
",3
"`Awesome keyboard,,  we need new theme and costume theme..!!
",4
"needs to use more of user words like in go keyboard!
",5
"So many useless symbols but no backtick (`)?!
",1
"Also: pressing a punctuation key needs to accept the prediction, then insert that symbol.
",1
"We also want custom gestures (paste, select all, move cursor, etc) and changeable detection sensitivity.
",1
"Needs swype,  sometimes doubles on letters, hate the fact that a space automatically equals a period but overall very impressive and worth my $
",4
"I tend to type very fast, and when I press a key on the right side of the keyboard, and immediately press a key on the left side, SwiftKey assumes I'm deleting a word.
",3
"Also for the love of God, give us keyboard shortcuts!!
",3
"Also, would love the ability to customize emotes.
",1
"Key press sounds are obnoxious.
",1
"add a hide keyboard button or fix response time please.
",4
"Chinese character not included..
",3
"Would love to see Swype added in the future..
",4
"This is a huge problem if you have an e-mail address/username/password with periods in them as you have to switch to another keyboard in order to enter them.
",1
"however, I would like more themes and maybe something along the lines of Swype to be added in the future for easier one-handed typing.
",5
"One recommendation, allow us to custom color the keyboard would be amazing!
",5
"I really wish it had emojiis
",4
"Love it,  but need new themes. :)
",5
"Would love the ability to customize themes.
",5
"I expected larger theme sets.
",3
"Waiting for thai languages.
",3
"The themes just seem a bit limited.
",4
"I just wish it had third party theme support like many of the others as the built in colors don't match my theme.
",5
"Im still missing option for Polish dictionary without special characters -
",4
"i wish to have ""normal""  letters only as these additional Polish (it's not common for Polish alphabet) letters take to much data on tex messaging...
",4
"Like everything but there is one thing missing what other keyboards have and that is having custom keys for emotion faces and as a 21 century teenager I like to have that option and thinking most teenagers have a smart phone as we are spoilt as hell then I would of thought you would of added this to your app many updates ago!?
",4
"Guess what u r thinking great app wish u could customize it more
",5
"Would be perfect with support for Japanese.
",4
"Only wish I could customize the skin to match the rest of my phone.
",5
"Biggest disappointment is the lack of Chinese language support.
",5
"And it's amazing how much SwiftKey is missing out on a 1.2 billion population country, not counting the also very large population outside China who also uses the Chinese language.
",5
"Only improvement would be the voice to text button.
",4
"Would rate 5 stars if it had more color customization for the keyboard, more themes.
",4
"Predictions are not working in any browser.
",3
"Good keyboard but the lack of accents is annoying, also that on SMS screen the return / next line button defaults to a smiley, otherwise, great keyboard.
",4
"When I use the phone's built in resizing ability, the keyboard is too large to see all the keys.
",3
"I wonder if swipe feature is available.
",4
"One thing I'd like to see is for it to change back to the keyboard after hitting the space bar in the ""123"" screen.
",5
"Love the keyboard would be nice to have themes you can customize.
",5
"But needs to be able to learn words better, or choose to assume curse words manually.
",4
"My only gripe is that there is no euro key and I live in Spain!
",4
"Needs bigger keys and more neon colors.
",3
"But Three quid is a very steep and would be better with more skins..
",4
"My main issue with the app is the ugly themes.
",4
"It would be great if there's UNDO, CUT,  COPY, PASTE buttons... and a Swype support.
",4
"Sliding would be a nice extra feature but when a keyboard is this good you don't really need it.
",5
"It does consume more battery than my stock but that's okay because it's precise and only wish it had more themes, or new style I check them all out but I don't like.
",4
"One change I would like to see: support for Japanese.
",4
"only thing I wish it had the option to swype that would be awesome....
",4
"Otherwise more themes and it would Rock!
",4
"I would like if predictions worked when typing urls into the browser on the gs3.
",5
"Not much customizations but I'm OK with that.
",5
"Emoji all my friends have it on there I phones and I'm missing out on the experience of using it in creative ways
",4
"Even tho SwiftKey doesn't have that gesture typing feature.
",5
"Don't like that some customization options aren't there and that common long press punctuation isn't on the main keyboard, but it's pretty good overall
",3
"Good engine, poor dictionary...
",1
"Lacks even the most essential words in Danish!
",1
"But needed to have a shortcut key to switch back to stock keyboard so I can typo Chinese on my s3
",4
"The only thing missing is a swipe kind of input.
",4
"Needs swype,  sometimes doubles on letters
",4
"1. Still hasn't pashto language support.
",4
"2. It's limited for 3 languages to same time in Language and layout option.
",4
"It makes difficulty for those who are using more than 3 languages.
",4
"Since updating to the latest Android on my Samsung nexus s, no matter how many times I switch the keyboard to swift key my phone keeps defaulting back to the standard keyboard.
",5
"I would like it more if it has tailoring for WhatsApp chats!
",4
"More keyboard themes would be nice too!
",5
"I would like Japanese support as well.
",4
"useful, convenient, such a nice keyboard but hope there will be more language such as Chinese or Japanese.
",5
"I know you won't see this, but please please please make an option to take off the pop up letters on each key press.
",4
"The only qualm I have with it is the layout of the secondary keys.
",5
"I use the Spanish dictionary more than English.
",5
"Only wish its tablet counterpart were as intuitive.
",4
"Everything looks okay but without Chinese input is funny!...and no Swype input?
",2
"Do you sp vietnamese lang thank
",4
"Can call or swift all they want bur it's no swype
",1
"Love how it works, themes are great, just wish that we could have our own personal dictionary in there.
",4
"Please include an autotext feature, and change the arrow key to the top and it Will be a perfect keyboard
",4
"Brilliant but doesn't offer suggestions in many situations, such as browser address bars and username fields.
",4
"but needs more themes :/
",5
"Please add this feature, I'm texting a lot with whatsapp over sms/messaging.
",4
"please please support the 3x4 korean keypad.
",3
"admittedly swiftkey has great english support, but i need to be able to use both languages.
",3
"the only reason that i havent switched to swiftkey over the samsung keyboard is the lack of 3x4 keyboard.
",3
"The beta for Thai version expired but there is no introduction of Thai language in sight.
",1
"Need for themes!!!!!!
",5
"Such as iphone theme and Windows Phone theme!!!!
",5
"""insert dot after pressing double space"" is disabled?? ??!!
",5
"No if it could only play nice with Google's Chrome mobile browser
",4
"Always double check before tapping the send button...and you'll be fine.
",4
"Love the keyboard so much, but there are only a few skins to choose from unfortunately.
",5
"SwiftKey is decent, but its customization options are lacking and I'm not a fan of how close the keys are to one another with no spaces.
",3
"If Swiftkey added the split keyboard & a few customization options the prediction engine in Swiftkey may be able to outclass Thumb Keyboard but not at the moment.
",3
"No supporting for several languages...
",1
"If they make it so you can personalize the dictionary, I'll redownload it.
",3
"like my title says, this could really use the ability to learn from Google Voice, otherwise very good app!

"I only wish it had options for alternate keyboards, such as XT9, which I prefer.
",5
"Brilliant predictive text but needs more customisation options, specifically, mic button, space bar and themes.
",5
"Although other language is supported these two language will make it a complete one single must install app.
",4
"Please make the default ICS theme available.
",5
"Needs ability to quickly and easily add words to a personal dictionary like Swype.
",4
"Faroese language is not registered, and I understand why because it is so small, but I wish I somehow could personalize the languages even more.
",4
"The only problem I have, which is not even really a problem, is the lack of this symbol ?
",5
"The only thing that can make it better for me is if it had Japanese.
",4
"PUT SOME NEW THEMES OUT!
",5
"But needs more customizable options such as keyboard color and dictionary.
",3
"For 5 star only need three ability to add custom themes.
",4
"Would love the option to have numbers above the Query like the default Galaxy Note keyboard!
",4
"Keep the themes coming
",5
"My only complaint is the lack of chinese input support.
",3
"Hopefully, we can see chinese language in the language pack support soon.
",3
"I'm forced to use other keyboards when i need to key in chinese characters.
",3
"It used to be the keyboard would recognize common phrases I used and predict the next words fairly accurately, but no more.
",3
"Might as well not even include the next-word prediction.
",3
"Feature request :sync my dictionary.
",5
"SwiftKey 3 is a great keyboard but some times it auto correct to much.
",4
"I wish it had emoji so bad.
",4
"Please support Vietnamese and Japanese!!!
",4
"When is more themes coming and update
",3
"Please allow use in places like browser searching and Google play while searching something.
",4
"Needs a close button though and some more themes
",3
"Uninstalling until SwiftKey swipe comes out
",3
"My only suggestion is that email address input is improved, it auto corrects my email address making it hard to log in to certain websites.
",4
"Nice word prediction, can't wait for the swipe edition :).
",5
"I lovee it ,  but can yall make more themes for the keyboard pleassee
",4
"Still quite buggy, lags terribly and slows down phone at times.
",3
"It helps to message really well,  but when it comes to filling up forms online (feedback, etc), the corrected words get inserted all over the place!

"(1) somes crashes when cutting/copying text, although it restarts itself in 20sec.
",4
"(3) sometimes locks up so that scrolling through text is lost when exceeds bottom of typing area.
",4
"Keyboard shuts out randomly..
",1
"It seems to conflict with the carrier (KDDI au) email app in regards to auto-capitalisation.
",4
"If switched on the first letter of every word is capitialised.
",4
"If switched off then first letter is always lower case.
",4
"If only it didn't become disabled every time I plug my phone in.
",4
"After a month using it, the keyboard types all over the place, also sending texts before completed.
",4
"I use Google Chrome a lot and it crashes a lot as well and it's because of the keyboard.
",4
"It's alright I guess but it seems to have a knack for freezing up high end devices
",2
"Is there a way to improve the speed of closing the keyboard when I exit an app.
",4
"It always seems to lag behind.
",4
"Only gripe is that it crashed on a couple of occasions.
",4
"Keyboard will not show when I need to type so I uninstalled and reinstalled and now I cannot download the language pack so it won't let me past the welcome screen.
",5
"Lags while typing.
",3
"Its annoying when it becomes slow
",3
"The thing I notice most is the removal of swiping backspace to delete a word.
",3
"It's so much faster to swipe to type!
",2
"Try to type some email addresses and you will know what l mean.
",2
"Not all words needs smart space.
",2
"However, on my new HTC One X (which has a considerably larger and more high resolution screen), I find the small size of SwiftKey to be virtually unusable for me, so I have reverted to the stock keyboard.
",2
"I have a Samsung galaxy s2 that was constantly crashing, amongst other problems.
",2
"It does the job but has some weird quirks.
",1
"U have to triple check all the word predictions and stupid commas when double hitting the space bar.
",1
"Works well but every time I restart my phone I have to change the keyboard settings.
",2
"But sometimes I feel it still isn't blending with the OS perfectly.
",5
"Or when I type an actual word and it corrects it..
",1
"Been waiting for a fix to the default keyboard being selected after reboot (instead of SwiftKey)  and just updated jellybean on my phone to 4.2.1 and it now seems like everything is okay...
",4
"Only problem is it eats up a crap ton of my cpu
",4
"On my new Note 2, I noticed that the keyboard occasionally becomes unresponsive especially the letters O and L.
",4
"Changed from 5 to 3 starts until the issue where the predictions don't show up after I turn my screen off then on again.
",3
"Best keyboard replacement I have ever used but it keeps popping up with select keyboard in the notification bar
",4
"I thought it was an ics problem but no other keyboard is lagging like this.
",3
"Was my standard now too laggy on my GS3.
",3
"The keyboard is awesome and the features are amazing but recently I've been having keyboard lag.
",3
"There is a slight delay when a hit the keyboard and then the letters show up.
",3
"Always reverts to stock keyboard.
",5
"Only thing, every now and then, it won't type, you have to go back to inbox and start again.
",4
"Doesn't work on Jellybean.
",3
"Lags a lot and also reverts to Samsung keyboard after every reboot.
",3
"Its seems like my sift key hangs completely when i try and type more than 3 words on watsapp, please fix :(
",1
"Evo 3d works awesome, got a new razr max and it is horrible!
",5
"Whatever you did fixed the bug on the razr maxx worked and couldn't be happier!
",5
"The question mark change??
",3
"With my S3 though, they keyboard tends to freeze alot, and stay held on a button so it types 4 words in a row, or continually deletes.
",4
"it slows it down and makes it really laggy.
",2
"Text boxes in browsers are lost under keyboard, as are password & other fields.
",1
"Key press on screen comes after touching the soft key and moving on to the next.
",3
"Currently running Android 4.1.2 and notice definite lag when typing.
",3
"Now it's slow and laggy, has glitchy predictions (especially when hitting delete/backspace), no theming support, and weird cursor jumping.
",1
"There is a (known) issue for Jellybean which causes the stock keyboard to reset every time the phone is switched on, so I need to manually go into settings and set keyboard to SwiftKey every time I restart my phone.
",1
"it butchers words pretty bad sometimes.
",4
"the keyboard doesn't disappear and appear as it should..
",4
"Doesn't learn some of the words that I've type.
",3
"When it has 2 languages selected it mostly makes predictions in one
",4
"Developers need to write better memory / display management.
",3
"Make it a stand alone button and make sure it works sometimes with Jelly Bean.
",4
"Unlike the ICS keyboard, backspacing does not get rid of the auto corrected word,  so I'm forced to delete it manually and select it from the suggestion bar.
",4
"it bothers me when I do spell words correctly and it still changes them to an irrelevant word.
",4
"Keyboard keeps resetting back to default on reboot.
",1
"Love it, but it needs more color selections.
",4
"There is a very slight slowdown while typing at times though.
",5
"Entering a period always inserts a space after, which cannot be removed (manually removing the space does not work as it gets reinserted).
",1
"Sometimes doesn't work and I have to uninstall and reinstall
",3
"I love this app but after the latest droid update my suggestions no longer show up nor autocorrect.
",4
"Has become laggy while typing.
",4
"Additionally, the default keyboard is often reset to the Android system keyboard upon reboot.
",3
"This app uses 30mb of my ram!!!
",1
"However it seems to me that it uses a bit much RAM for a keyboard.
",4
"It needs an Emoji plug in so I can delete garbage go keyboard
",4
"Uses too much ram and slows down phone drastically
",3
"It also doesn't correct words with a line of under them.
",3
"Predictions are horrible, though enjoyed the added spaces for commas and periods.
",3
"Its a great app for any tablet or phone, but it will slow down my Nexus 7, I removed the app and my Nexus has been running smoother, fix the performance and I'll be glad to reinstall it on my tablet
",3
"Lately there's a periodic lag while typing; also not sure about this new smart space thing.
",5
"Slow to close when exiting messaging program.
",3
"Really bogs the Galaxy S3 down.
",3
"This makes tying incredibly slow ans I reverted back to the normal android keyboard.
",1
"After updating to 4.1.2 it gives error when installing
",5
"Am running ics and it worked good in the 1st couple of days then my phone started to have this hanging problems.
",2
"I'll lower my rating to 4 stars since the Jelly Bean bug resetting the keyboard to stock at each reboot has been around for long without being fixed.
",4
"Does not function properly when my galaxy note 2 is used horisontally to write email on my office email account (exhange server -  using original samsung email app being pre installed) .
",4
"Text is jumping up and down when writing!
",4
"Hate hate hate that it inserts spaces when typing an email.
",1
"But use alot of ram
",5
"This is the best featured keyboard I've used so far but the lag when typing in many apps makes it almost unusable and very very frustrating.
",2
"I love the keyboard my only problem with it is when i have it on it doesnt allow for me to get notification noises or vibrations for text messages even though it says that it is set up right and should be working.
",4
"Prediction better than stock keyboard, but slower at loading keys when need to use it.
",5
"Makes typing a lot quicker but word predictions don't seem to work for me when using some apps such as Youtube
",4
"Worked a couple times before crashing.
",1
"Unusable due to 'network error'	Worked a couple times before crashing.
",1
"Now can't get beyond choosing English language download due to 'network error', no matter how good my connection is.
",1
"This app causes forced close crashes with the Al Jazzeera English news app.
",1
"When SwiftKey is running the Al Jazzeera app won't even open.
",1
"But it adds a space after every punctuation, so it makes it nearly useless if you're picky like me or need to type email address a lot. Until they fix this or add an option to disable it, there are better keyboards.
",2
"hate the fact that a space automatically equals a period but overall very impressive and worth my $
",4
"UPDATE: so many issues with Chrome that have been acknowledged but not fixed.
",2
"unable to loan the bahasa melayu language pack.
",5
"Probably not SwiftKey's fault, but it there is a new bug on my Nexus S 4G with Jellybean: when the device restarts, it forgets all about SwiftKey and resets to default keyboard.
",5
"This keyboard uses 54mb of ram as opposed to 9mb for the stock keyboard.
",3
"Makes your phone much slower.
",3
"Freezes a lot!!!
",3
"In addition, sometimes the suggested word list disappears until the keyboard is minimized and then brought back up again. This happens on both my galaxy nexus and nexus s and has been happening for the past year despite updates to the app and android os.
",3
"Sometimes though, it lags a little bit but apart from that, couldn't ask for more!
",5
"Not recommended if you're still using Gingerbread -- very sluggish and tends to miss keystrokes, as well as hog memory.
",5
"Makes my Samsung Nexus actually usable!!
",5
"I could not make full use of this app because it kept on saying ""our servers are busy.""
",4
"Type something, select the completion and the current text isn't replaced with the selected word, but removed entirely.
",2
"Combining multiple languages in one keyboard (one for de/en_US instead of two different) is crap as well.
",2
"When you are sending an email, if you are in the middle of a word fixing a typo and SwiftKey is suggesting a word, sending the email will send with the word underlined.
",1
"Originally loved it, it's skipping around when I'm trying to use Chrome and other apps, hopefully this gets fixed
",3
"Enter key should work as space key, but also inserting a new line.
",5
"For some reason, sometimes inserts a ""dot"" before a word, and I'm not sure why!
",5
"***Still can't save email addresses that have a '-' in them!***
",1
"Also very laggy in landscape mode with GTalk.
",1
"But the cursor tends to jump around in the text box...so you end up quickly typing foolishness.
",4
"It's much better than normal key board but so annoying sometimes the words it just chucks in front of other words before you have even started typing for the next word.
",4
"The only issue I have is that every time I power down my phone it defaults back to android keyboard and I have to restore SwiftKey as my default.
",4
"Hides keyboard every so often while typing on S3 and makes screen flash at times :c
",3
"Also if I have my main language set to English, Spanish 2nd. Why do you give Spanish preference as soon as I start a word?

"The devs did not fix the round brackets in Hebrew for more than a year, it's mirrored.
",1
"Good but: when auto-correcting in search box on google home pages, corrections are entered into wrong place not replacing mistake.
",2
"Predict doesn't always function	Good for email but the prediction bar doesn't work in many browsers and apps, including Google search.
",2
"Whenever I post on a forum the text field comes up as normal and I begin typing but you can guarantee that at some point during my post composition the cursor will suddenly shoot back to the beginning of the body of text and proceed to type over my opening words!!!
",2
"Don't know if it's you or Chrome, but typing in a text box and selecting a prediction with the letter I causes the cursor to jump up the text box and type over previous sentences. Examples: I, I've, I'll.
",5
"so when I am typing a text, the auto correct lags behind then inserts the mistake repeatedly back to back. not only that, but by the time it catches up, it has already sent the message.
",2
"additionally, in the chrome browser the keyboard won't let me type in the appropriate space. It starts in the middle of a word or some place random that makes no sense.
",2
"There is glitch in voice dictation button.
",3
"The blinking ""marker"" randomly skips around backwards into the sentences you previously wrote when you try to type sometimes..
",3
"And when completing words,  the last letter gets replaced by a blanc space. ""like thi ."" or the first letter gets dduplicated. (since last update it happens really often) .
",3
"also have the ""c-v-b bug"" instead of space.
",1
"After updating to Jelly Bean OTA its so slow to type.
",1
"Have reinstalled also and done a factory reset. But it always lags so much while typing out anything even on my Galaxy S3...
",1
"Predictive text feature not working most of the time,  only seems to work when sending.
",3
"Keyboard will not detect typing field 50% of the time, have to close Google Crome and open several times to enter basic Google search
