",1
"i thought it was just me but i lost my 4th tank ..
",2
"dnt know how ..
",2
"i've been playing this for over a year ..
",2
"if you have to spend fish bucks to buy fish - the fish should be sold back for fish bucks and not coins.
",1
"if your going to pay coins when fish are sold, you should have more items involve coin buying and not bucks.
",1
"last update failed miserably.
",2
"can no longer breed.
",2
"bred fish missing.
",2
"dropped the ball.
",2
"where all my fisj, they are gone, plz fix it

",4
"awsome so much like having your own real tank but with more exciting fish
",5
"too costly.
",3
"especially when taking a crap ;-)
",5
"unfortunate that you have to spend your own money for bucks, coins or download other games to receive few free ones .
",3
"otherwise a great app.
",3
"fun game
",5
"challenges are not nearly so impossible now.
",4
"the game had multiple glitches... in my favor!
",5
"they fixed them, but not before i made billions in coins.
",5
"bucks are still hard to come by, so decide wisely on how to use them.
",5
"at one time i gave a 5 star rating.
",1
"since all the recent updates all it does is force close .
",1
"which sucks because its my favorite game when the bugs aee fixed will go back to 5 stars.
",1
"also as others have mentioned you need more breedable fish to buy for coins not fish bucks.
",1
"shame on you this was listed as a free game (free) yet you need fish bucks for everything!!!!!
",1
"at least consider trading coins for fish bucka so everyone can enjoy the full extent of the (free) game .
",1
"love the game but get really stressed out and mad when my fish die cuz i didnt feed it.
",4
"download asap!!!!!!!!:)

"i'm irritated.
",1
"good game for timepass.
",5
"cool game but fish bucks are few and far between.
",4
"too hard to collect the bucks.
",4
"i can't stop playing.... so good.
",5
"game is absolutely brilliant
",5
"cool game rather addicting.
",5
"just wish some of the fish weren't so expensive (in fish bucks)
",5
"i love this game but since i updated it the last time it force closes on me 9 out oc 10 times please fix the problem i have android oltimus
",5
"great game
",5
"tap fish
",5
"great fun.
",5
"but need to be able to trade coins for fish bucks.
",5
"also,  lost my game once and now having trouble getting it transverse to a new phone.
",5
"great game.
",5
"once upon a time i rated this app 5 stars but as of last update my enjoyment level has changed.
",2
"i like getting the extra coins for 100% happiness but that no longer happens because  all my tanks are now 65% at best and i took nothing out of them to change it......there are other weird things going on as well like no algae build up!!!
",2
"nevertheless the game still deserves 2 stars because i still get to see my fish grow!!
",2
"it's kinda boring to me...maybe because i don't fully understand the game
",3
"great way to kill some time!
",4
"this is my favorite game there is never nothing to do on tap fish
",5
"so fun but i lost every thing when i uninstalled it for space.
",5
"i didnt give me an option to restore but it is still really fun.
",5
"also all the fish usually cost a couple thousand fish bucks and 1300 fish bucks is one hundred dollors!
",5
"so i think you should make them cheaper.
",5
"cause noone can really earn all those fish bucks and they probobly wont spend 300 dollors on one virtual fish.
",5
"i am addicted.
",4
"love the fish, so cute.
",4
"great fish events.
",4
"however, i don't want to start over.
",4
"this is really a good game love it
",5
"i really liked the game until i went on and had a tank missing.
",1
"then 14 fish bucks.
",1
"sent an email asking for help and was basically told to be more careful not to delete my tanks.
",1
"i guess i shld have tried to be more careful and not delete my fish bucks too.
",1
"bull.
",1
"thanks for nothing tap fish for your help.

",5
"great game i love it
",5
"no access for 2 weeks since update.why are you not fixing this bug for us.
",3
"forces close on opening.
",3
"fish look mostly realistic.
",3
"they don't have enough varieties of creatures/decorations for the currency you mostly make in game.
",3
"example i dont think seahorses are available for coins only fish bucks.

",4
"fun and makes a neat background but hassle to get enough fishbucks to buy stuff should b able buy stuff wit jus coins kinda dumb they want u use real $ for fishbu ks to get stuff for fake fish on a free app
",4
"awesome game
",5
"i really enjoy this game im at level 71,been playing since jan the yr.
",5
"i give you guys a lot of credit making it pretty easy to   get fishie bucks unlike many games that make it almost impossible.
",5
"i also understand the need to make money to keep the game going.
",5
"but when you put a quest out lately the things you need to buy are pretty high.
",5
"during the quest would it be possible to get these items at a discount?
",5
"then once over and people still want the fish for their collection have them at full price.
",5
"it's like taking care of real fish but when these die you can revive them back to life.
",4
"i must admit that i have been harsh in my reviews of tap fish by gameview studios in the past, however that is no longer my opinion.
",5
"since it's debut in 2010 they continue to add new fish & adventures that make each day a delight & a nice escape from the worries of my own poor health.

"update: lowering from 4 to 2 * due to earning fishbucks issues...i have been receiving less fishbucks upon completion then the offers state.
",2
"one said 22 would be earned and i only received a few (i believe it was 3 for that one).
",2
"another i just completed by installing and opening robinson said it would give 7 and it only gave 2.
",2
"it happens too often to be an isolated glitch.
",2
"it seems as if you deliberately overstate the amount of fishbucks for offers.
",2
"many never pay at all.
",2
"i can't even see the quests with the new update and if i accidentally hit them it force closes and asks what way i want to send an email.
",5
"that doesn't even make sense.
",5
"also it's slower than before and seems to have more excuses to force close.
",5
"i wish it hadn't updated.
",5
"awesome and additive
",5
"i try to find ways to make the most coins.
",5
"fix the way u click sponge n change tank to clean it is easy to do and less time consuming
",5
"don't bother updating, the past version was much better.
",1
"they have gone and phucked it up again.
",1
"tanks list spacing is huge, cleaning tanks lags, can't continue action after switching tanks (buying fish for multiple tanks in series), opening breeding tanks lags, battery usage seemed to improve though....  thought they would have tested this update a bit more since the disaster that happened last time...fix.

"didn't get the new year event until yesterday and it will only be open 2 days.
",1
"this game hardcore tries to get your money.
",2
"it starts you off with simple goals then every achievement after that requires you to buy fish bucks.
",2
"if your looking for something to waste time with it's not bad.
",2
"otherwise be prepared to blow money.
",2
"i'd give it above 2 stars if it had more achievements that didn't require blowing money.

",3
"just wish some of the fish weren't so freaking expensive!
",3
"ay yay yay!!
",3
"love the 'event's tho... super fun!
",3
"it gets harder and harder to level up to purchase enough tanks for all breeds of fish and the event fish.
",5
"this is a fun way to pass the time but the developers are way too greedy.
",4
"everything in the game has a price and a lot of those prices are extremely high.
",4
"while there are various ways to get the currency of the game for free, the amount is generally a pittance when one considers most of the prices.
",4
"if you want more, it costs real money and for what i would receive for that money, the price is just way too high.
",4
"you also have to""visit""
",4
"regularly since time passes in the simulation even when you connected
",4
"what happened to that feature of play; when the fish didn't go after the food until the fish saw the food... that made it fun... please, bring that back...
",3
"took everything away twice.
",4
"was at level 30 the last time.

"very disappointed.
",3
"but it did save my rating!
",3
"thats weird.
",3
"it saved my rating but not my game.

"i have 3 limited breedable fish but when i put one in the breeding tank it says ""you don't have limited breedable fish, buy some now"", please fix this

",4
"i had hundreds of dollers worth of fish backgrounds plants decorations all in 58 tanks lost it all when i had to change phones because my phone went bad not happy i cant get that back i dont want to start over love the game i just dont want to start over
