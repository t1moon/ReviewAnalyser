",4,1
"this is a great game but certain functions like cleaning the tank don't work well on a phone...
",4,1
"with a few adjustments like making it easier to get cash and coins as well as the cleaning problem this would be an amazing game
",4,1
"the only downside is that more than half the fish are only available thru in-game purchase of fishbucks.
",4,1
"the fish cost to much and they made up half the fishes names
",3,1
"i love the breeding events the best though, don't really like the submarine ones :/

"get ffree fish with purchase of tank bucks is quite unfair to those of us who cant afford to spend $$ when new fish are avail for breeding.

"gr8 app passes some time away but i dnt like every time i open the app i get a pop up

",4,1
"last quest had a ridiculous amount of monsters
",4,1
"crashes a lot but still worth it
",4,1
"this game for me right now is a four star game, but if they lower the fish prices and if sometimes they would also give you fish bucks when you sell a fish, it will totally be a five start game!!:)

"i just wish it were easier to get fish bucks .....
",5,1
"simply because all the cool stuff you can only get with fish bucks....

",3,1
"now i have to get more bucks to revive them!
",3,1
"it is a nice game for my 3 year old but it is very addictive and requires the purchase of fish bucks to really get any where in the game.

"just wish it was easier to get fish bucks n some fish weren't so expensive
",4,1
"great except the stupid fish bucks feature, that makes you either buy them or download apps.
",2,1
"fun game glitches out lots and takes your fish bucks with out buying anything
",3,1
"i'd play more if it was a little cheaper.
",3,1
"also that bubble needs to go, it interferes and gets in the way..

",3,1
"with this game  but howcome i sale the with bucks only coins you need to upgrade it
",5,1
"only thing that i don't like is that getting fish bucks is so hard.
",4,1
"the only thing i feel could use some improvement, are the few and far between chances you get to earn or win tapfish dollars.
",5,1
"me personally,i would make it just a bit easier and not so random ,to win dollars.

"fun game glitches out lots and takes your fish bucks with out buying anything

",3,1
"this last update does not allow me to clean the tanks so all my tanks are at 65% happy. i gave made no changes to my tanks but the update caused this.

",5,1
"no doubt all my fish are dead too!!
",1,1
"its very irritating not to have enough fish bucks, you should allow us to earn it..
",3,1
"fun game but if your phone dies you have to start from scratch.
",3,1
"the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is sometimes it refuses to start and i have to reboot my tablet to get it to work which can be annoying.
",4,1
"needs more ways to win fish cash but good game
",5,1
"please make available to exchange the money on game for fish bucks
",3,1
"it's rather decent, but the animations/graphics are rather sloppy and breeding is very slow.

",3,1
"i love this but getting bucks only to hard pls make this as easier ....
",5,1
"amazing but needs more events but get it downloaded,best game ever!!!
",5,1
"works great on my tablet, my only issues with this game is the difficulty to earn coins and fish bucks. if those were easier i would play more often and i would actually buy them because i know i would be able to earn more after i blow through them so quickly because of the steep prices.
",5,1
"i also read that there are some quests u must pay cash for and you can not skip it. we should be able to skip those even if we had to spend some coinage to do so.
",5,1
"fix the ease of collecting coins, fish bucks, and lower prices in the store and it would be even more fun.
",5,1
"but it's hard to level up and gather up some bucks...
",4,1
"love game but freezes on daily spin
",4,1
"it would be nice if you could earn fish bucks with some of the breeding fish.

"3 of my favorite fishes to buy and sell are all gone.
",4,1
"da big icons and the bubble r so rediculous!
",4,1
"but i ddnt like the way it looks at my toshiba tablet.
",4,1
"its cool but it gets too repetitive there needs to be something more in between the growing, selling and breeding of the fishes.
",4,1
"the only thing its missing is more fish,room and fish bucks its great but sometimes boring!
",3,1
"fun but not enough to do everything takes so long. breeding, growing and so on
",4,1
"i like this a lot, but force closes soooo often
",4,1
"i love this game but it would be great if you could use your coins to buy fish bucks.
",5,1

"only downfall is when i got my new phone i lost my previous game
",5,1
"tapfish is a nice game but when it come to the bucks i a problem since i have no i have to wait 3 day.

"also if you pay for bucks you only get coins when you sell.
",4,1
"if you could earn bucks that would help.
",4,1
"and if they got their time straight that would help too...
",4,1
"just wish there was a way to trade in coins for fish bucks. don't like having to buy them in order to get the fish i need for trophies or challenges in breeding.
",5,1
"should be able to earn fishbucks easier or at least make some of the fish cheaper other than that seems like a pretty long term game not bad

"i wish it wasn't so dependent on spending real money.

"i love the game i just wish it didn't take so long to get money
",5,1
"i love this game but i do wish that you could get fish buck way easier
",5,1
"love the game,  but it needs to have more fish you can buy with coins and less that you have to use the fishbucks for.
",4,1
"to complete the game will cost u more than $200.
",1,1
"so, you aknowledged the fact that the frog challenge had a glitch by changing up the way to purchase the eggs but you won't reimburse the fish bucks lost because of that glitch?
",2,1

",5,1
"its just i ain't willing to spend money for fish money
",5,1
"great ggame but takes too much internet
",5,1
"only thing i would change are the notifications.
",5,1
"would rate it a 5 star but for some odd reason i can't breed any of my mystery fish so it's like if i bought them for nothing!:(
",4,1

"never got my 100 dollar worth fishbucks
",1,1
"i went to open my game an it says new bee event but nothin is there so u went to see if it needed updated an its up to date.
",5,1
"plus i lost 20 fish bucks during the frog event & i'm not sure how it happened.
",5,1
"takes way too long to breed fish though.
",3,1
"and it is irritating that you don't stay in the shop when buying multiple fish.
",3,1
"clicked on  bubble and accidentally lossed all fishbucks.
",3,1
"would like to get the fb back.
",3,1
"was fun, but, the new bubble is ridiculous, and when i went to.buy one fish, i couldn't make it stop until i had no more bucks.
",1,1
"also, alot of the free buck opportunities, do.not give you.the bucks and the fish prices have become outrageous :(
",1,1
"i would say the only thing i dont like about it is that its hard to earn fish bucks,and alot of fish you have to buy with the fish bucks....
",4,1
"so i would rate this app as perfect if you were able to get free fish bucks and or earn them easier...
",4,1
"and twice since the update all of my fish bucks have disappeared.

"love this gane but would be great if the fish grew faster

"wish there was a better to get fish bucks
",4,1

",5,1
"needs more ""free cash & coins"", but over all very cool game.
",3,1
"i like the app but it wont let me buy fish so there is point keeping the app.
",3,1
"would like more coin fish less $ fish and the tasks given to be for coin fish not $ fish
",3,1
"the fish that i'm breeding for the current event are disappearing when i move them into the tank.

",4,1
"i did not receive the two frogs for breeding.

"please give me my  frog so i can breed them.

"force closes alot but still love it.....
",5,1
"great time waster but to many fish for fish bucks i mean i have no money for fish bucks there needs to be less fish for fish bucks.

"it takes a while to load at first but its worth it!
",5,1
"it's fun but there isn't much to do after you clean the tank, feed and love the fish.

",5,1
"i just wanna say that i love tapfish i just have one suggestion can u guys plz come up with some kind of password so that when friends who dont know what their doing grab ur phone and start messing with stuff dont sell all ur fish and mess up ur tanks.
",5,1
"i think there should be a way to level up faster because it takes forever trying to level up, and maybe there should also be a breedable catagory for lazy people (such as i) that way we dont have to spwnd a half hour trying to find breedable fish

"do more batfish
",5,1
"can't breed new fish often cause i can't get more than 2 tanks to bread, then it takes on average 3 days to breed one fish lol.

"enjoyable game,,,slow to start though.

"love this game but i wish you could get more fish bucks for free.
",4,1
"boring and stupid because you need lots of money to buy things and they barely give u any

"for 2 days and now it won't open any more

"takes to long to level up and most quests take $ to complete!
",1,1
"it doesn't give u hardly any coins for tending to ur fish!
",1,1
"however, it takes way too long to earn bucks.
",3,1
"the challenges are fun at first but then it gets old.
",3,1
"it constantly asks to buy more bucks.
",3,1
"there should be an option to exchange coins for bucks.

",4,1
"a little cluttered and slow.
",5,1
"also alot of focus on fish bucks, which are hard to get without buying them.
",5,1
"i wish there was more way to earn fish bucks.
",5,1
"this last update stole millions of coins from my tank not to mention all the bs with the frog event.
",1,1
"the only downfall is hard to get fish bucks without buying them.
",5,1
"maybe trading coins for bucks or awarding more bucks when leveling up.
",5,1
"would rate higher but to obtain breeder fish and other things you need to pay2play and i just can't offord it.
",3,1
"dislike bubble tips and smiley faces on feed fish.
",3,1
"it is very fun but make it a little more interactive with the fish
",5,1
"i wish they could put in a permanet mini game to get fish bucks,coins,fish or decorations ethre
",4,1
"its a cool game but its stupid you can progress if u don't have bucks wilhich u need credit card for

"it'll glitch everytime i go to play store then exit it and click the game itself on the phone it just goes right back to play store
",4,1
"not giving all fishbucks when you download games also when foggy event was over did not receive breedable frog did not get my fishbucks when i download game also played the froggy event and did not get breedable froggy
",5,1
"it does take an awfully long time to level up,  and it's unfortunate that so many basic things can only be bought with ""fish bucks"" which are very difficult to earn many of without paying money.
",4,1
"and many quests require you to buy these things.
",4,1
"i just wish you could advance up quicker yeah you can speed up your fish eggs to hatch.

",4,1
"great app try to purchase fish bucks though other apps but, still waiting the only bad thing
",5,1
"but i do think a 12 hr breeding time for a total of 90 fish to breed is a bit long for shorter event time.

"live wallpaper needs to be fixed also : (
",4,1
"the new event is not giving me the prize when i bred my fish and 11 hours thats a little to long to be able to get everything.
